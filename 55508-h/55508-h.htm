<h2 class="nobreak">TRAINING THE MEMORY</h2></div>


<p>The memory is the most used of all the faculties,
therefore it is very important that it should have
special attention and training. Almost every exercise
in the First Book, while developing the other
faculties, used the memory in some manner. It is
necessary for the success of most mental operations.
Memory influences thought, and contributes to character
development.</p>

<p>A good memory is the greatest aid to the student
at any age. Lack of knowledge of how to use and
improve the memory has been a great handicap in
the life of most of us. It is no longer necessary for
your children to be continuously dependent upon
the operation of the memory, without knowing how
to properly use it. From this book you will get a
practical understanding of how to develop this faculty
for them.</p>

<p>The young child has little conception of the importance
of Memory. Do not use your time trying
to impress the value of memory upon him, but rather
in helping him to do the things which will result in
the development of this faculty. By training the
child's memory you can endow him with the knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
and capacity which will be an ever increasing
source of profit, and for which he will never cease
to thank you.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>To start your children in life with a trained
and dependable memory is a greater endowment
than a perfunctory education or even a
fortune.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>This is not only your privilege but your duty. The
decision to do so must be yours. At first the principal
effort and persistence must come from you.
Follow carefully the instructions of this book and
you will have no difficulty in accomplishing this desirable
result.</p>

<p>First read the entire book, then apply the ideas
and exercises according to the age of the child.
Let the children advance as rapidly as they can master
the work. Do not over urge them, or make the
work tedious. Above all, see that the children understand
the principles and apply them to all of
their activities.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Memory is largely a habit. See to it that
your children acquire this habit early.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Let your effort be continuous and not spasmodic.
Ten minutes a day is far better than an hour once
a week.</p>


<h3>Memory Most Valuable Faculty</h3>

<p>The development resulting from use of the games
and exercises of the first book has already influenced
the memory faculty of the child. The faculties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of visualization, observation, attention and concentration,
all contribute to the proper operation
of this faculty. They are the tools with which the
desired result can be accomplished. It is of greatest
importance that these tools be sharpened and
tempered by use of the exercises given in Book One.
It is now important that you know and understand
the principles and methods of memory operation.
Study this book with your children, if they are old
enough to understand it.</p>

<p>For smaller children follow the plan of making
the instructions into stories, and the exercises into
games. Encourage the children in making the effort
necessary for improvement and to expect a great
deal of themselves.</p>

<p>The story of the success of great leaders of present
day business and industrial life reveals the fact that
they had an unusually retentive memory. That
their minds were great storehouses of facts and figures
regarding their business.</p>

<p>Others who had worked along with them for
years, but were not able to absorb and retain the
knowledge, could not progress as fast or as far. All
have the natural endowment of a good, dependable
memory and all have the faculties, which, if properly
trained, will result in conscious ability to use
the memory for all the needs of successful living.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Your memory is your ability to make an impression
upon your brain which you can recall
at will.</b></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>This involves two mental processes; first, the making
of an impression upon the brain; second, the
ability to recall it at will. The problem of memory
is to know how to accomplish these two things and
to be able to produce the result easily and quickly.</p>

<p>Five groups of nerves connect the brain with the
outside world, these are the five senses. They are
the avenues of approach over which all impressions
or sensations are conducted to the brain.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The ease with which any impression can be
recalled will depend,&mdash;first, upon how
strongly it is made.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Your senses are unequal in their ability to impress
the brain. Some make stronger impressions than
others, not so much because of the thing to be impressed,
but because of the natural unequal strength
of the groups of nerves. All experience or knowledge
that makes a strong, definite impression is more
easily recalled than in those cases where the impression
is less distinct.</p>

<p>Nature has endowed one of the senses with a
peculiar ability to make impressions upon the brain
which are many times stronger than those made by
any of the others. To learn to properly use this
one sense is the greatest aid to memory improvement.</p>


<h3>The Strongest Sense Is Sight</h3>

<p>The nerves connecting the eye with the brain are
many times larger than the nerves of any of the
other sense organs and can make an impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
which is many times stronger than the impression
made by any of the others. Without your conscious
knowledge this fact has been operating all your life.
The things which you have seen are the things which
you have most easily remembered. For this reason
the memory of your youth consists principally of
things which you saw, or impressions made upon
your brain by the use of your eye.</p>

<p>Prove this fact; recall some of your earliest recollections;
how did your brain accept these impressions?
Was it through feeling, hearing, or through
seeing? It is an eye impression and is recalled in
your mind as a picture. You will find that most
of the past which you can remember is based upon
the visual impression. The poet says, "How dear
to my heart are the scenes of my childhood." The
scenes of childhood are the memory of childhood.</p>

<p>"Travel is the greatest of educators." Why? One
reason is because you are gathering a group of eye
impressions which are the most lasting. One psychologist
defines memory, "as the act of recalling
the picture of a past experience." The fact that the
visual memory is most lasting has been known for
generations, but we have failed to take proper advantage
of the fact. In making a comparison of
the eye and ear impressions upon the brain Robert
Mudie wrote in 1832: "That which is told us we
may forget because of the weakness of the impressions
made, but that which we see with our own eye
is proof against accident, against time and forgetfulness."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>


<h3>Visual Impressions Most Accurate</h3>

<p>Besides being the strongest of all the senses, sight
is the most accurate. Psychological tests have
shown the eye to be mistaken only eighteen per
cent of the time, and the ear, which is the second
sense in strength, is mistaken thirty-four per cent.
Note that your sense of sight is especially endowed
with the power to make the strongest, and at the
same time, the most accurate impression upon your
brain. The first step in memory improvement is to
learn the proper use of this sense in impressing upon
the brain those things which you wish to recall.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>For the purposes of memory, to see a thing
once is equal to having repeated it eighteen
or twenty times.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>Nature's Special Memory Endowment</h3>

<p>We have a secondary or additional faculty which
we call the mind's eye. You can close your eyes
and see many familiar scenes or you can combine
parts of these into new pictures that have never
existed in fact. This process of visualization produces
the strongest impression upon the brain that
you are able to make.</p>

<p>The greatest step in the improvement of the memory
is reached when the child realizes the value of
this visual impression and is conscious of just how
to use it.</p>


<h3>A Memory Picture</h3>

<p>Become familiar with the mind's eye picture and
realize its value in memory, then follow the exer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>cises
given here until you are able to use it correctly
for memory purposes. For practice visualize a
House, use one that is familiar to you, see it as
clearly as possible. Build a clear, definite picture
as an artist would, first the outline, then add the detail,
see the slope of the roof, the chimney, the
gables, then see the shingles and the cracks between
them, the bricks in the chimney and the plaster
veins between.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The more distinctly you can see this object,
the stronger the impression upon the brain&mdash;the
longer it will last and the easier it will
be to recall it.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>The use of the exercises on Visualization in Book
One will make it possible for you to build at once
a clear picture of the House. If you have any difficulty
in doing this, follow the instructions for drawing
the outline and other suggestions given for the
development of the faculty of visualization as they
are found in the first book.</p>


<h3>The Visual Impression Strengthened</h3>

<p>To remember you must be able to make an impression
upon the brain which you can recall at
will. This simple impression of the House may not
be recalled as easily as you wish, but there are
three simple and natural operations of the mind by
the use of which you can strengthen this impression
to any degree necessary. By their use you can learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to make an impression that is strong enough to be
recalled at will.</p>


<h3>The First Aid&mdash;Exaggeration</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_014.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A large object makes a stronger impression upon
your mind than a small one, a twenty-story building
attracts your attention and impresses you more than
a two-story one. Things which you see exaggerated
out of their normal proportions make an unusually
strong picture upon your brain. The House, which
you have seen standing in the yard is small; if you
wish to increase the
strength of the impression,
exaggerate the
size of the house and
see it as large as a ten-story
building. The
only limit to the size to
which you can exaggerate
the object is the
limitation of your imagination.
You can in this way strengthen the picture
until the impression is strong enough to be recalled
when needed.</p>


<h3>Others Make You Remember</h3>

<p>This idea of exaggeration is not new or unusual.
There are two professions whose business it is to
make us remember and they use this principle in
doing it. They are the advertiser and the cartoonist.
You have seen this same exaggeration of proportion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
in nearly every cartoon, but you think nothing of
it. The cartoonist, however, knows that he can
make a stronger impression upon your mind by its
use. You remember the cartoon longer and recall
it more easily than most anything you read.</p>

<p>One of the largest advertising companies of the
country makes the statement, "A picture is worth
a thousand words when it comes to making the public
remember." Some of the most successful advertising
campaigns have been largely confined to pictures.
Almost without exception pictures drawn
for advertising purposes take advantage of this
principle and strongly exaggerate the proportions.
You have seen this in the pictures used by the Goodyear
Tire Company, the Bell Telephone Company,
and many others. It is illustrated in the picture
given here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Second Aid&mdash;Motion</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_016.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>You often pass a thing that is motionless without
notice, but if it moves it attracts your attention.
While walking down the city street you pay little
attention to the show windows, but if there is something
moving in one you will stop to notice it. The
sidewalk will even be blocked by the simple motion
of some thing in the display. This is the use
of motion to impel your attention. If you are in
a crowd and see a friend whose attention you wish
to attract, you wave your hand or handkerchief.
Children like to see "the wheels go 'round," and we
never lose the fascination which motion has for us.
A person lacking in the power of concentration will
fix his closest attention upon the moving picture or
object.</p>

<p>Just as the motion picture is more attractive than
the old style stereopticon, so motion introduced into
the visual pictures for memory purposes will increase
the impression upon the brain and increase
your ability to recall it.</p>



<p>To still further strengthen the impression of the
House, see it in motion instead
of standing still. See it
on wheels moving down the
street or blown from the
foundation by a strong wind.
The farther you see the object
move, or the more rapid
the motion, the stronger the
impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>


<h3>Third Aid&mdash;Unusual Associations</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_017.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>When you go home in the evening the first thing
mentioned is the unusual happening of the day.
Those things which have been most out of the ordinary
are the first mentioned in your conversation.
If some very unusual circumstance has thrust itself
upon those at home, they
will rush out to meet you, to
tell you perhaps that "The
cat devoured the canary."
All unusual circumstances
impress the mind in such a
manner that they are very
easily recalled. To see the
House balanced on one corner
instead of in its usual position upon the foundation,
will strengthen the impression of the picture
already made. Take advantage of this natural fact
and when you wish to remember make the picture
an unusual one, even make it grotesque or ludicrous.</p>

<p>There is no limit to the degree in which you can
use these three natural mental operations. Your exaggeration
of a pin can make it appear the size of
a pencil or a telephone pole, or as tall as a twenty-story
building. You can see it move a foot or two
or swinging in a pendulum-like rhythm or dancing
upon a hill.</p>

<p>Thus the use of these three principles makes it
possible for you to place upon your brain an impression
of whatever strength you choose. If the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
one is not recalled readily you know how to make a
stronger one. Simply exaggerate the size, move it
farther or more rapidly and in a more unusual or
ludicrous manner.</p>


<h3>Value of Improved Imagination</h3>

<p>The unusualness of this picture is dependent upon
your imagination. This idea of picture making for
memory purposes is two-fold in its value. It results
in a better memory and strengthens the productive
imagination. The exercises in Book One will help
you to use your imagination for these memory pictures,
and making them is one of the best exercises
for the development of the imagination.</p>


<h3>Practice Makes Perfect</h3>

<p>You now know how to make a strong impression
upon your brain. This has proven to be the most
valuable aid to a better memory. Thousands of successful
men have learned to use it practically in their
work. It is the greatest aid to students in assimilating
and recalling their studies.</p>

<p>You have the knowledge, but to be of value you
must practice with it sufficiently to prove its usefulness
and to learn to apply it accurately. This practice
can be gained in a variety of ways; the essential
thing is that you train yourself to make strong visual
impressions upon your brain, to see the pictures
clearly and to know that you are recalling them
accurately. For practice let us use a list of common
objects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>In order to recall a list of objects or a series of any
kind, instead of making separate pictures of the
objects, combine two in each impression. If you will
follow the method used in making the following
Memory Pictures you will find that it will enable you
to recall the objects at will. We will use a list of
objects that have no natural associations, that you
could not easily remember by any other method, yet
when you use this visual process the matter is a
simple one.</p>


<h3>First Picture Association</h3>

<p>The first word of the list will be the House, the
second Clock. We have already made a strong visual
impression of the House, by seeing it in an Exaggerated,
Moving, Unusual picture. We could make as
strong an impression of the Clock in the same way,
but to be able to recall the word following House,
we must see the two objects together in the same picture.
To see a large Clock standing alongside of the
House, will make a strong impression. A stronger
one may be made by exaggerating the size and proportion
of the two objects. To further strengthen
it you can use unusual motion, such as balancing a
huge Clock on the edge of the House. Now introduce
motion, see the Clock topple and roll down the
roof and fall to the ground. To get the full value of
this impression upon your brain, close your book and
see the picture in your mind's eye. If it does not
seem distinct close your eyes, or take a pencil and
try to draw the picture. This will help you to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
it more clearly. See the Clock rolling down the
roof, see it fall to the ground, make it seem real and
as distinct as possible.</p>


<h3>Add Flowers to the List</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_020.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>To do this make a large moving picture of Clock
and Flowers. See the Clock decorated with flowers
and large bunches tied to the end of each of the
hands. See them going
around. Add the colors,
make all the detail bright,
and become interested in the
picture. Fix your attention
on it as you have learned to
do in the first book. Note
the changes.</p>



<p>In each of these pictures
there are two objects, never
more and never less. Do not see the House in this
second picture. Always drop the first object when
adding a new one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Memory Pictures Should Always Contain
Two Objects.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>Flowers and Circus</h3>

<p>Continue the list by adding the word Circus. Picture
the new word with the last one which was Flowers.
Let your imagination see the Flowers playing in
the circus tent, see them riding the horses, or have
the performers all dressed in flowers; any picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
clearly visualized and concentrated upon for a
moment will produce the desired result.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The length of time that an impression will
last, depends first, upon the vividness of your
picture.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>Circus and Soldier</h3>

<p>Add this new word by exaggerated motion picture
of the Circus and the Soldier. Make your own picture,
see that it is definite and let the mind dwell
upon it for a moment.</p>


<h3>Soldier and Church</h3>

<p>Proceed in the same way as before, but do not go
on with the list until you have visualized the picture
clearly. A dim picture will not last long and will be
recalled with difficulty, if at all.</p>


<h3>Church and Rocks</h3>

<p>Not stones, but great, rough, rugged rocks piled
high. See them clearly, let them fall on the Church
and damage it. When recalling your pictures you
will need to be sure of the object and to recall the
exact word. The ability to do this will depend upon
the vividness and definiteness of the picture as you
see it the first time.</p>


<h3>Rocks and Auto</h3>

<p>Here is an opportunity to imagine and picture an
auto accident. Make your own picture and photograph
it upon your mind.</p>

<p>Proceed with a few more pictures, making each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
clear and definite and do not yet attempt to recall
them; just visualize each two objects in turn.</p>


<h3>Auto and Shoes</h3>

<h3>Shoes and Dishes</h3>

<p>See each two objects in a separate Memory Picture.
Now review the list beginning with House and
Clock, Clock and Flowers, etc. Let one picture suggest
the next in which one object of the preceding
picture always appears. Repeat the list slowly, recalling
the two objects in each picture. Do this without
looking at the list; there are ten separate objects
you can check by keeping count.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="indent">House and Clock.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Clock and Flowers.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Flowers and Circus.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Circus and Soldier.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Soldier and Church.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Church and Rocks.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Rocks and Auto.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Auto and Shoes.</span><br />
<span class="indent">Shoes and Dishes.</span><br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>Review the ten pictures until they can be recalled
without difficulty, and until all are clear and distinct.
Each time you review, see the same picture as originally
made, do not change it, except to add more
Exaggeration, Motion or Detail each time and make
it more distinct and definite. You will have experienced
the fact, that in each case where you made and
visualized a good picture you remembered the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
without difficulty. Where the picture is not strong
you have trouble in recalling the word. Any picture
that can not be recalled easily can be made to do
so by adding more of the three elements, Exaggeration,
Motion and the Unusual. Take the poorest picture,
the one most difficult to recall, exaggerate the
size of the objects, or make them move farther or
faster, stand them on their heads or do any thing
unusual and see how much easier you can recall it
the next time.</p>


<h3>Two Mental Operations</h3>

<p>There are two distinct operations in this method.
First the Imagination takes the two objects and
determines how they shall be arranged; what they
shall do; or how they are to look in the picture.
Second, the mind's eye photographs the picture so
arranged by the imagination. The impression is
made upon the brain when the picture is photographed.
You may decide upon a good combination
of the objects, but if you do not SEE the picture you
will not remember. The impression is made upon
the brain when the mind's eye actually sees the picture
which your Imagination has constructed. Just
as the photographer first arranges his group in the
manner that he thinks will make the best effect, then
presses the bulb and exposes the plate. If he only
arranged the group and did not expose the plate he
would have no picture, and so, if you imagine the
picture and do not SEE it, you will have poor memory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>


<h3>Add to Your List</h3>

<p>In the same way form pictures of the following objects.
Use your own imagination to bring the objects
together into motion pictures. In adding to
your list, always begin with the last object and revisualize
it with the new object. Thus you will link
all together in an endless chain. Make memory pictures
of the following:</p>


<h3>Dishes and Wagon</h3>

<p>Pile the dishes high upon the wagon and see them
rattle off and break as the wagon moves. Be a cartoonist,
make unusual pictures.</p>


<h3>Wagon and Table</h3>

<p>Make your own picture, and fix your attention
upon it for a moment by seeing the details. What
kind of a wagon is it? What color? How drawn?</p>


<h3>Table and Carpet</h3>

<p>See the color and pattern in the carpet.</p>


<h3>Carpet and Fence<br />
Fence and Bread</h3>

<p>It will be easier for some to make the Memory
Pictures into a story, that is to see the Dishes thrown
at the Wagon and fall off onto the Table where they
are put into a Carpet and hung up on a Fence, which
has a loaf of Bread on the top of a high picket. This
story can continue indefinitely, as long as your imagination
adds to it. There is a danger, however, in
this kind of a picture; it is in the tendency to see
more than two objects in each picture. The idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
may be continuous, the picture must never be. It
may be a continuous idea connecting separate and
distinct pictures but you must be sure to drop the
first object before you add the new one, so that there
are but two objects in each. Continue picturing
these words in pairs as you did before, using the
story idea if it seems easier.</p>

<h3>
Bread and Walk.<br />
Walk and Lamp.<br />
Lamp and School.<br />
School and Stove.<br />
Stove and Piano.
</h3>

<p>Now, go back to Dishes and review the pictures,
naming both objects in each picture. Can you see
each clearly? If not, strengthen the picture, put
in more motion, or make it more unusual.</p>

<p>Without the aid of the list go back to the House
and recall the entire series from House to Piano.
After you have succeeded in this, try to see the series
of pictures and speak them as a list, thus,
House&mdash;Clock&mdash;Flowers&mdash;Circus&mdash;Soldier, etc. Do this a
couple of times until it can be done without hesitation.</p>


<h3>You Can Reverse the Process</h3>

<p>Test the availability of these visual impressions
that you have made by starting with the picture of
the Piano and follow each picture carefully back
to the House. Thus, Piano&mdash;Stove&mdash;School&mdash;Lamp&mdash;etc.</p>

<p>You now have a series of twenty unassociated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
words so impressed upon your mind that you can say
them forward or backward. You can as easily begin
in the middle and go either way, or you can think of
any word at random and tell which word precedes
it or follows it in the list.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Strong visual impressions properly associated
can be recalled at will.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>It has taken some time to make and photograph
these pictures, practice will soon make the process
so easy and natural that the same result can be accomplished
in a few seconds. It is not unusual for
children, after a little practice, to take a list of
twenty words and visualize them in one careful reading,
so that they can recall them in any order desired.
Practice will do the same for all regardless
of how difficult they may find the idea at first. All
have the faculties, awaken them and make them
serve.</p>

<p>The important thing is not that the child has easily
learned a list of words which he can repeat forward
or backward, but the fact that he has experienced
the memory value of a definite mental operation.
The learning of the list is merely the exercise through
which the process of visualization is applied to the
memory. The child may possess the knowledge, but
practice is the only way to make it most useful. This
same kind of exercise should be continued and will
later lead to many practical applications.</p>


<h3>Three Steps Necessary</h3>

<p>All educational progress has three steps, To Know;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
To Do; To Be. What a child becomes as he grows
to manhood depends upon what he DOES, with what
he KNOWS.</p>

<p>Knowing is the first essential, but without the doing
there is little result. The purpose of this book is
memory development.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The improvement of the memory will depend
upon what the child does with the knowledge
he receives.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>Sharpen the Tools</h3>

<p>Your experience has proven that poor, weak impressions
are recalled slowly and with difficulty. At
the same time when you succeed in recalling a poorly
made impression it is indistinct, it lacks that clear
definiteness which brings assurance and confidence.
To overcome this you need to sharpen the tools with
which the impressions are made upon the brain. You
cannot expect the best results from untrained senses
any more than a carpenter can expect to do a fine
quality of work with dull tools.</p>

<p>The senses can be sharpened and improved as you
have seen in the First Book, but practice is the whetstone
and every stroke will produce its proportionate
result; without it you can not expect to become
proficient in anything. The methods by which the
senses can be trained are suggested in the First
Book, and if they have been overlooked, or slighted,
you can now see the importance of paying proper
attention to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Practice is the motive power which can propel
you along the road of progress toward the
goal of perfection.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>Continue the Memory Pictures</h3>

<p>In the same manner in which you learned the first
twenty words fix the following in mind. Begin with
the last object of the previous list, Piano and add the
next one, Spoon.</p>

<p>Now, add to Spoon, Road. See a Spoon with arms
and legs running down the Road. Make a real cartoon
of it. Continue to picture the words in pairs,
always dropping the first when adding a new one.
Now take Road and Picture; Picture and Desk; Desk
and Window; Window and Apple; Apple and Book;
Book and Door; Door and River.</p>

<p>Stop a moment and review these Memory Pictures,
first in pairs as Piano and Spoon; then as a list. Now
go over the list backwards.</p>

<p>Add more words and be sure you stop each time to
see a clear, definite picture. You must fix your attention
upon it for a moment, use motion, exaggeration
and the unusual.</p>

<p>Picture River and Dress; Dress and Hammer;
Hammer and Ball; Ball and Train; Train and Gun;
Gun and Moon; Moon and Curtain; Curtain and
Pepper; Pepper and Bed; Bed and Scissors.</p>

<p>Review the series as before, those pictures which
come slowly should be improved. With the book
closed, start with House and repeat the entire list.
See each picture clearly before you speak the word,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
even though you may feel sure what the following
word is, see the picture first, this will insure accuracy.
Then begin with Scissors and go through the
series of pictures backwards working your way, picture
by picture, back to House. Take time to be accurate,
do not try to go rapidly at first. See each
picture and try to see it more clearly, adding all the
detail you can. Mental exercise is necessary to development.
See that you perform this one often and
accurately.</p>


<h3>Have Learned Forty Words</h3>

<p>When the child can say the list he has learned a
series of forty words which he can repeat forward
and backward. These words are unassociated and
would be difficult to learn by the old cumbersome
method of repetition. Yet the feat is accomplished
easily by the application of these simple and natural
principles.</p>


<h3>Be Gratified But Not Satisfied</h3>

<p>Do not be satisfied that these simple facts, and the
use which has been made of them, has proven resultful.
Ideas are only of value because of the profit
which comes from their continued use. Prove their
worth to your utter satisfaction and then by continuous
effort make them a part of the mental makeup.
Become thoroughly familiar with these principles
and see that the child knows just how to proceed in
the use of them. Remember it is the visual faculty
you are cultivating for great future usefulness, not
merely learning a list of words. Review these pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
many times, use the same ones, do not make
new ones.</p>

<p>Avoid the mistake of seeing only one object at a
time; always see two, as the House and the Clock,
the Clock and the Flowers. This causes one picture
to recall the next, because the object appears in two
pictures, or is associated with two objects. One by
natural mental operations recalls the other.</p>

<p>For further practice and development add to the
list of forty words now learned, some of those following,
or make a list of your own. Any words will
do, picture them two and two and review them after
you have added ten or so.</p>

<h3>To Develop Definite Pictures</h3>

<p>Some persons have difficulty in making their pictures
definite enough to avoid confusion between
objects of similar shape. Overcome this difficulty
by teaching the child a few lists of objects somewhat
similar in shape. This will require making
clear and definite pictures. The exercise following
is a good one for this purpose. Visualize the following
list and see to it that the pictures are definite,
so that they can be recalled in proper sequence,
either forward or backward.</p>

</table>


<h3>Animal Lists</h3>

<p>The same kind of practice can be gotten by the use
of lists of animals, and at the same time another result
may be attained. The child must learn just
what the animal looks like before he can picture it.
In learning these animal lists use the dictionary or
encyclopedia, or better still, good books on natural
history, and show the child the picture of each
animal with which he is not familiar. Teach him all
that you can regarding each of these different
animals. He will then be able to picture them
clearly and retain and recall them without difficulty.</p>

<h3>The Law of Association</h3>

<p>The first requirement of memory is to make a
strong impression upon the brain, and this we have
seen is accomplished by visualization. We concentrate
the strongest of our senses upon the thing we
wish to remember and thus make the strongest impression.</p>

<p>The second necessary step is the ability to recall
the impression at will. This is equally important in
memory and is made possible by the Law of Association.
Prof. Kay states that, "Association is the
means by which what is in the memory is recalled
and brought again before consciousness."</p>

<p>Things which are impressed upon the mind, or
which are active in the mind at the same time, will
return together, one will suggest or recall the other.
A voice, a sound, a sight will often recall a long
train of events. One event will recall another that
took place at the same time, or in the same place, or
one similar in detail. These associations are easily
formed though you may be unconscious of the fact
at the time. When one of the associated facts is in
your mind it becomes the means by which the other
is brought again into your consciousness.</p>

<p>The visual picture is the strongest impression that
can be made upon the brain, but to be able to recall
a new impression at will, it should be linked or associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
with some already familiar picture which is
easily recalled, and this will bring the associated impression
with it.</p>

<p>In the visual exercise in which a list of words was
learned, beginning with House, this principle was
used. The strong impression was made upon the
brain by seeing the House. You also made a strong
impression of the Clock, by seeing it, but in order to
remember that the word Clock follows the word
House the two were associated together by seeing
them in the same picture. This is an example of
two things impressed upon the mind at the same
time. When you see the House it brings the Clock
into mind. If you wish to recall what word follows
House see the House, and the picture association
will supply the second object.</p>

<p>The use of this Law of Association made it possible
for you to recall the list of objects. To be easily
available the objects must be linked together as
strongly as possible, and this is accomplished by the
associated picture.</p>

<p>Association is one of the fundamental laws of
mental activity, the use of which is absolutely essential
to memory operation. In the pages following
you will notice the application of this same principle,
always using the visual method because of its
unusual strength and accuracy.</p>

<p>Much has been written on the subject and some
memory courses dwell on it at great length. There
are just two essentials to be always kept in mind:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>First, to be able to recall the new fact at will it
must be impressed upon the mind in association with
some familiar knowledge that will be easily recalled.</p>

<p>Second, the visual picture is the strongest association,
therefore the most lasting and easily remembered
and at the same time it can be used for all
needs.</p>

<p>This law of association must be used continuously,
without it there can be no accumulation of knowledge
or memory. Its operation is simple and need
not be in the least confusing.</p>


<h3>Reminder Pictures</h3>

<p>A simple use of the visual memory is to make a
picture of the thing which you wish to do, in the
place where you wish to be reminded of doing it,
called Reminder Pictures. This principle can be
applied to errands and to very important ideas. Seeing
the thing you wish to do will form the strongest
possible impression. By seeing this picture in the
place where you wish to be reminded of it, you have
associated it in your mind in connection with the
thing which is to be used to bring it again into your
consciousness.</p>

<p>The latter half of the picture&mdash;the place in which
you wish to be reminded of it&mdash;must be familiar, at
the same time a place or object which is going to be
physically visible at the time you want to be reminded
of doing the errand. This principle can most
easily be understood by the use of illustrations which
are actual examples of how others have used the
idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<h3>Forming a Health Habit</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_035a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Believing in the value of a glass of water taken
before meals one person made a picture of a large
glass of water covering a greater part of the dining
table, and when coming to the table he saw himself
spill the glass of water. It is essential to have two
objects in the picture&mdash;one, the thing you wish to
be reminded of doing; and the other, a familiar
scene which you are going to see at the time. In
this case, when the person
sees the table, which is half
of the picture, it brings back
into consciousness the large
glass of water. This reminds
him of drinking the
water before sitting down to
the meal.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_035b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A lady had been forgetting
to get a certain rug which had been put away
in a dark closet, and which she feared might be injured
by the moths if it was not taken out and used.
As is often the case in such
circumstances, she thought
of this rug many times, but
always when it was inconvenient
to get it. She made
a picture of the door of the
closet in which the rug was
stored and also of herself
passing this door; the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
flew open and the rug jumped out into the hall at
her feet. Later, when she was passing, seeing the
closet door it reminded her of the rug and she
stopped, opened the door, took out the rug and thus
attended to the matter which she had been forgetting.</p>

<p>A business man had been forgetting to telephone
an associate. He made a picture of the desk in his
office, and when he rolled up the top of the desk
the friend jumped out and scared him. This picture
was made in the library of his home in the evening.
Next morning when he saw the desk the rest of the
picture came back to his mind and he took up the
telephone and attended to the matter.</p>

<p>These pictures may include more than one object,
or even more than one errand. What the average
memory needs is a hint to start it on the right track.
A husband had been asked, when leaving the house,
to order some groceries before going to the train to
meet some friends. He made a picture, of his car
standing where it would be when he was ready to
leave the office, and over the whole car he spread
a large beefsteak, on one end of the steak he saw a
bag of sugar, on the other end he saw a bag of coffee,
then he broke an egg over the whole, for these
were the things which he was to order. When he
came from his office, seeing the car, a part of the
picture, it reminded him of the groceries, and he
easily remembered the things wanted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>Pictures which are exaggerated, have strong
motion, and are unusual or even startling, are best
for this reminder idea. The pictures must be seen
clearly in the mind's eye, and the part of the picture,
which is used as the reminder, must be something
which you will see clearly at the time you wish to do
the thing. The illustrations given are from the actual
experiences of busy men who are using this idea in
their daily life.</p>

<p>This application of the visual memory can become
invaluable to the child. In cases where the desired
result has not been procured the difficulty, almost
invariably, is a lack of vividness in seeing the place,
person, or thing which is to act as the reminder. It
must be familiar, definite, and clearly visualized.
Practice will improve the results. Make an effort
to see detailed and distinct objects in your pictures
and use the strengthening elements. Here are a few
additional examples of how children have used this
idea. It works.</p>

<p>A child was sent to the grocery store for four
items, and instead of carrying a list he made a picture
of the counter in the store as his reminder. The
items to be purchased were a sack of Salt, a bottle
of Vinegar, some Fly Paper, and Potatoes. He pictured
the Fly Paper sticking on the edge of the
counter and on it balanced the sack of Salt and the
bottle of Vinegar, then he saw himself throwing the
Potatoes at them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>A picture of this kind will enable the child to remember
a few items without difficulty. The Hitching
Post idea which follows soon will be more accurate
and enable him to extend the list to any length.</p>

<p>A boy, who often went away to school without
bringing in his wood, made a picture of himself running
out of the door to school, when slipping off the
porch he sailed through the air and landed on the
wood pile. The next morning, when he went out of
the door and across the porch, his picture flashed into
his mind and he stopped and brought in some wood
before leaving.</p>

<p>A girl had formed the habit of throwing the towel
on the chair instead of hanging it up. She made a
picture of herself throwing down the towel when it
became entangled in her feet and tripped her up as
she walked away, throwing her headlong.</p>

<p>Reminder pictures of this kind must be visualized
by the child, even if suggested by the parent. Do
this pleasantly and even playfully, being careful not
to arouse the antagonism of the child. If he is stubborn
in the matter you can gain nothing, unless you
secure his co-operation and pleasant interest. To
keep these pictures in mind and to use them at every
opportunity will aid in forming correct habits. Make
them startling and interesting, and when possible,
put real feeling into them. Induce the child to feel
the pain of his fall; feelings give life and power to
visualized pictures.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>A boy was told to stop at a neighbor's and deliver
a note for his mother on his way to school. He pictured
the front gate of this neighbor's fence swinging
out and stopping him. He tried to go over the
gate and the more he climbed, the higher it became.
Seeing the gate as he passed on his way to school
reminded him of the note.</p>

<p>A tablet was needed at school and had been forgotten
several times. A picture of the tablet barring
the door of his home, so that he could not get in,
reminded the boy to go at once to the store and make
the purchase.</p>

<p>On her way to church a girl was given a message
to deliver to a certain lady, after the service. She
pictured herself trying to get out of the door of the
church, but the lady blocked the way refusing to
allow her to crowd through. When she started out,
seeing the door, which was part of the picture, it
reminded her of the lady, and she delivered her
message.</p>


<h3>Beware of Procrastination</h3>

<p>One of the most subtle foes of a good memory is
procrastination. Like conscience, memory can be
dulled and almost ruined by continual disregard of
its suggestions. Failure to act when reminded ruins
what memory power you have and retards your
progress and further development.</p>

<p>A Reminder picture will suggest an errand or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
duty one&mdash;two&mdash;or more times, but there is an ever
increasing lapse of time between each reminder.</p>

<p>To Procrastinate&mdash;to put off doing the thing will
dull the suggestive power of the memory. It will
clutter the mind with undone things which will cause
mental worry. It will weaken the will power.</p>

<p>To Act&mdash;to accomplish the thing at the first suggestion
quickens and improves the suggestive power
of the memory. It clears the mind for new thoughts
and plans. It relieves the nervous strain and increases
and strengthens the volitional power.</p>

<p>It is the child's memory you wish to improve and
this can only be accomplished by his effort. You
must help, of course, but do not do too much, merely
suggest. Get him to imagine and visualize his own
pictures, it will be better for him to make the effort
than for you to make it for him.</p>


<h3>Attention and Memory</h3>

<p>The subject of Attention and Concentration has
been discussed in the former book, but it will be well
to note their relation to memory and how we are
using them here.</p>

<p>We have introduced motion into the mind's eye
picture to strengthen its impression; the result comes
from a prolonged period of attention. In the exercises
for cultivating the power of attention we used
the method of change, or motion. It produced prolonged
attention, which results in memory. Exaggeration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
and the unusualness of the imaginary picture
inspires that quality of involuntary attention
which helps to produce concentration.</p>

<p>The quality of the stimulus to the attention is improved
by introducing anticipation, pleasure, or
their opposites. The clear, vivid, mind's eye picture
creates a greater quantity of attention, and if
the objects are familiar they add to the possibility
of clear visualization.</p>

<p>The attention should become fixed upon the picture
and this can not be done if they follow too rapidly.
Take time to make the impression and for
best results become as much interested in it as possible.
Every means which results in prolonging or
intensifying the attention improves the scope and
accuracy of the memory faculty.</p>


<h3>The Child's Code List</h3>

<p>For further practice in learning lists of words, by
visualizing the objects, use the one following. These
words are selected to conform to special requirements,
and form a complete code which is to become
of great value later. It should be learned thoroughly
so that each word can be recalled quickly
and in exact sequence. Use this list now in preference
to the previous one, as this one is to be used
in future, and the other will not be. Learn ten at a
time and review them, then take the next ten, joining
them to the last word of the previous ten, thus
making an endless chain of the one hundred words.</p>

<h3>The Game of Code</h3>

<p>A game to develop accuracy and rapidity in the
use of the words of this Code List. Cut one hundred
cards about two by three inches, or the size of game
cards. On one side of each print a word of the
Code list.</p>

<p>Shuffle the cards, deal ten to each player and let
the balance become a draw pile. The one to the
right of the dealer plays into the center of the table
any card which is the first of a series of ten Code<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
words as printed in the lists above, for example&mdash;Tie,
Dot, Net, Meat, Heart, Lady, Shed, Kite, Foot,
Bath. All first cards as named must be played first,
then the cards containing words which follow consecutively
in the list must follow. All cards held by
the player which can be played on any series started
on the table must be played in their proper turn,
including those in the played reserve piles.</p>

<p>If a card is played out of its proper sequence the
first one noticing the mistake calls "Code" and shall
be entitled to give a card from his hand into that of
the player, who must correct the error and cease
playing.</p>

<p>When a player has completed his turn, has played
all possible cards, or has been stopped, he will place
one card face up on the table in front of him as a reserve
pile. Each player is entitled to six reserve
piles, each lying face up and side by side. When a
player cannot make at least one play, he shall draw
into his hand from the draw pile until he can play or
until the draw pile is exhausted. Each plays in turn
until some player has played all the cards from his
hand, which entitles him to the game. Any player
who completes a series of Code words, puts on the
last word of the series of ten, takes away the set
and these can be shuffled and added to the draw
pile if necessary.</p>

<p>The winner is entitled to one point for each card
left in the hands and reserve piles of the other players.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
The score of the game can be set at any point
above 200, and the first reaching this takes the set.</p>


<h3>Remembering Errands</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_044.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>After the child has become familiar with the Code
List he will be able to use the words in a very practical
way in remembering errands and lists of groceries,
etc. The objects of the list can easily be recalled
in exact sequence, and can now become
Mental Hitching Posts to which any errand or runaway
idea may be safely hitched for future usefulness.
The thing to be remembered can be pictured
with the object of the Code list and when wanted it
is simply necessary to recall the word of the Code
list and it will in turn recall the thing visualized
with it.</p>



<p>Let us take a practical example. You are sending
the child to the grocery store with an order. The
first item is a loaf of Bread. Have him picture this
with the first word of the
Code list, Tie. Take the Tie
and bind the loaf of Bread
with it, tying a huge bow
with the ends moving in the
wind. See this picture clearly,
the color of the tie and
the shape and details of the
loaf of Bread. Of course the
Child is to make his own picture wherever possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
A boy would probably use one end of the tie around
the loaf and swing the other over his shoulder.</p>

<p>The second item is a package of Matches. See the
box lying on the Snow, which is the second word of
the Code. Let the box be open and some of the
Matches burning, see the black ends of the Matches
in contrast with the white
snow.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_045.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The third item is a box of
Raisins. The third code
word is Home. See the box
open and the Raisins spilling
all over the Home.</p>

<p>The next item is Potatoes
and the code word Wire.
Have him imagine a sharpened
wire on which he is stringing the Potatoes.</p>

<p>The next item is a glass of Jelly and the next code
word Wheel. See the large Wheel run over the
jelly and break the glass.</p>

<p>The next item is Flour and the code word Sash.
Drop some Flour over a new red Sash.</p>

<p>The seventh item is Coffee and the seventh code
word is Egg. Break the Egg and spill it all over the
Coffee.</p>

<p>The eighth item is Butter and the code word ivy.
Hang the Butter on the Ivy and see it swinging there.</p>

<p>The ninth item is Soap and the ninth code word is
Whip. Stand the soap on end and strike it with the
Whip&mdash;see the lash wind around the Soap.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>The tenth item is a can of Corn and the code word
is Toes. Let the boy imagine himself balancing a
can of Corn on his Toes.</p>


<h3>The Visual Result</h3>

<p>A picture of what is now in the mind should show a
systematic filing of ten grocery items, each hitched
by picture to one of the familiar Hitching Posts. The
pictures may be somewhat like the following:</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_046.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>Have the child run over the code words and tell
the item that he sees pictured with each. If the items
are recalled once that is all the review necessary if
they are to be used in the same day the pictures are
made. He will be able to go to the store any time
that day and by recalling each word in its proper
order will recall the ten items just as they were pictured.</p>


<h3>Another Practical Application</h3>

<p>The same method can be used to fix in mind a list
of errands which are to be done at different stores
and at different times. It is simply necessary to hitch
the errand to the Hitching Posts by picture and then
recall the Hitching Posts in order, each will remind
you of the errand visualized with it.</p>

<p>For practice, have the child begin with the second
series of code words and picture the following
errands with them. Review them once and after a
few hours see how many he can recall.</p>


<h3>Errands for Practice</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Dot&mdash;Buy some stamps.</p>

<p>Town&mdash;Get toilet soap.</p>

<p>Dime&mdash;Buy fish.</p>

<p>Deer&mdash;Go to the Hardware store.</p>

<p>Towel&mdash;Have shoes repaired.</p>

<p>Dish&mdash;Get a spool of thread.</p>

<p>Duck&mdash;Get some meat.</p>

<p>Taffy&mdash;Get a Victrola record.</p>

<p>Tub&mdash;Stop at the jewelry store.</p>

<p>Nose&mdash;Buy some writing paper.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>


<h3>Always Be Systematic</h3>

<p>The best results will be attained from using one
list for groceries and another for general errands.
Always start with the first word of a series of ten as
printed in the code list. Never skip around. Any
picture will answer if it is clearly visualized and the
attention fixed upon it for a moment.</p>

<p>Review the list once to be sure that the child has
made and visualized a definite picture. One review
is sufficient to be able to recall the items accurately
in the next twenty-four hours.</p>


<h3>Applications Are Limitless</h3>

<p>The principle involved here is one which will apply
to any need of adult, as well as child, life. Whenever
there is a need for remembering a list or series
of any kind the mental Hitching Posts can be relied
upon to accomplish the result, if the method is properly
applied. Business men are using this idea every
day of their lives and working more efficiently because
of time saved and increased accuracy. Use
this yourself and see to it that your children form
the habit.</p>


<h3>Important Points to be Followed</h3>

<p>For best results in using this idea:</p>

<p>Always use the same series of code words for the
same purpose, do not change lists from day to day.</p>

<p>Be systematic, always file the first item or errand
with the first object of the series you are using; do
not skip around.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>Any Hitching Post will carry any impression
which you wish to place there. Your mind only
needs a hint to start it right.</p>

<p>Be sure and photograph the picture which your
imagination constructs. You will not remember it
unless you see it.</p>

<p>Review once for safety. If you are filing a list of
items or errands then review each picture and be
sure you can recall it accurately before going on to
the next.</p>

<p>To file permanent information which you wish to
retain and use occasionally it is necessary to review
your picture several times and to concentrate upon
it longer to strengthen the impression.</p>

<p>For temporary purposes, such as lists, errands, or
things you wish to recall once and then discard, do
not review but once.</p>

<p>The difference between temporary and permanent
information is in the amount of review. Every repetition
of your visual association deepens the impression.</p>

<p>Start your new lists always with a new series of
code words even though you have not used all of the
previous list. Begin always with Tie, Dot, Net,
Meat, Heart, or Lady, etc.</p>

<p>To forget, refuse to allow that with which you
have finished to re-enter your mind. Do not recall
the old pictures, even for an experiment, let them
fade away after they have served their purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>


<h3>Value of Forgetting</h3>

<p>The reason that you find it impossible to forget
certain incidents and circumstances of life is that
you have allowed your mind to go over and over
these incidents and thus to make the impression upon
the brain so deep that it has become a lasting one.
Each review deepens the impressions and makes
them more and more indelible. For filing information
permanently in the mind this is the proper process.
For all temporary purposes, simply make the
visual impression: review it to see that it is properly
filed, recall it when you wish to use it and then refuse
to review or again to see the picture.</p>

<p>To forget means to get-for. You must get some
other thought or picture into your mind in place of
it. Do not waste time trying to force thoughts or
pictures from your mind. Get some other picture or
thought in its place as quickly as possible.</p>


<h3>Alphabetical Hitching Posts</h3>

<p>The list of code words given here is not the only
thing which can be used for this idea. The only
essential is a series of easily pictured objects which
can be recalled quickly, with little effort, and in accurate
sequence. There is however an additional
reason why these particular words of the Child's
Code List are better adapted to this purpose than
any others. This reason you will fully understand
later in this book.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>For the use of children and adults who are not
familiar with the Code list it is simple and practical
to use the A, B, C's as Hitching Posts. In this case
it is simply necessary to have an easily visualized
object beginning with the letter of the alphabet, so
that, for example, the letter A will without hesitation
bring to mind the object Ant, which can be pictured
with the errand. For the majority of children
it is not practical to visualize the letter A with the
errand, but the Ant can be easily used by all.</p>

<p>Following is a list of suitable objects to represent
the letters of the alphabet. It will be good practice
to learn them all, though you may only use the first
few.</p>


<h3>Alphabetical Hitching Posts</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>Ant</td><td>      Hand</td><td>     Owl</td><td>      Vine</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bee</td><td>      Ink</td><td>      Pig</td><td>      Wolf</td></tr>

</table>


<h3>Filing Abstract Ideas</h3>

<p>Everything which you wish to remember does not
take form in a definite object which can be visualized
and often presents a more difficult problem. Fortunately
the mind only requires a hint or suggestion
to start the Law of Association into operation which
will bring the thought not in itself easily pictured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
As the child progresses his imagination will find
many original ways in which to create Reminder
Pictures to aid him in remembering abstract ideas.
This ability will not come except by practice and
effort; if he is allowed to consider the remembering
of abstract ideas an obstacle to success it will
be so; but if he tries to master these he will find it
is not difficult to create a picture which will remind
him of what he wishes to remember.</p>


<h3>Reminder Pictures</h3>

<p>It is of course more difficult to construct a picture
for an abstract thought or word than for a simple
object, but it can be done, and becomes easier with
each effort. In some cases it may require an elaborate
picture to remind you of a single word. Note
the following abstract words and example of how a
reminder picture aided in recalling them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Contest&mdash;A footrace.<br />
Noisy&mdash;Boys pounding tin pans.<br />
Stuck&mdash;An auto stuck in the mud.<br />
Melancholy&mdash;A watermelon and a collie dog.<br />
Success&mdash;See a well known successful man.<br />
Financial&mdash;A pile of money in a bank.<br />
Secrecy&mdash;Two people whispering together.<br />
Contrary&mdash;A mule refusing to move.<br />
Immovable&mdash;An Egyptian Pyramid.<br />
</p></blockquote>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>Christianity may be represented by a cross; cold
by a piece of ice; heat by a fire; light by a lamp;
love by a heart; pride by a peacock; spring-time
by green grass and budding trees.</p>

<p>You are familiar with the old man with the sickle
and forelock used to represent Time; the maiden
with the balance and sword representing Justice;
and the little scantily clad fellow who represents
the New Year. These are examples of successfully
used reminder pictures.</p>


<h3>Thought the Desired Result</h3>

<p>In some cases you may not succeed in constructing
a definite picture for the thing which you wish to
remember. Memory is brought about by interested
attention and concentration. In cases where the
visualization proves to be difficult or even impossible,
you will experience the fact that the effort
made to form the picture has produced sufficient
concentration to help wonderfully in the problem
of remembering.</p>


<h3>Thinking by Pictures</h3>

<p>If you have never given it thought it will surprise
you to notice how much of our thinking is in picture
form. The architect sees the completed building,
sees it in detail and puts this creation of his
brain on paper to guide the builder in reproducing
it. The engineer sees the completed bridge spanning
the chasm before a workman has turned a hand
to rear it. All successful captains of industry think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
largely in pictures. Children do so naturally and
lose the ability by lack of use and substitution of
the "more modern methods," some of which are
most detrimental. See to it that your children appreciate
the value of visualization, that they use
it continuously in their thinking and study.</p>


<h3>Uses of Hitching Posts</h3>

<p>This picturing your errands with code words is a
principle of mental operation the uses of which are
almost limitless. It will be profitable to note how
business men apply it in their business.</p>

<p>A physician lists his calls and the appointments
he has made.</p>

<p>A factory manager hitches up the many instructions
he wishes to give during the day.</p>

<p>A lawyer uses six words for the six days of the
week and hitches up his court appointments.</p>

<p>A salesman makes a list of his calls, arranges
them in the best order, and fixes one with each word
of the list.</p>

<p>A groceryman uses it for remembering the things
he needs to buy for his stock.</p>

<p>A real estate man lists some of the places he has
for sale to be able to talk about them when away
from his office.</p>

<p>A salesman lists his selling points systematically
and does not leave out any important ones.</p>

<p>Anecdotes and stories can be listed and easily
recalled when wanted.</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>Points of a sermon or lecture can be quickly pictured
with definite words and recalled later.</p>


<h3>Speaking Without Notes</h3>

<p>One of the most valuable applications of the
"Hitching Post Idea" is its use for fixing in mind the
points of a talk, sermon or lecture. Most of the
nervousness of talking in public is caused by the
fear of forgetting. It is doubt of your ability to recall
the points you wish to talk about. This is easily
overcome by the use of your Hitching Posts. If you
wish to make five points in a talk, make a picture
to remind you of each point and hitch them in turn
to the first five words of a list. Review the picture
a couple of times, be sure that you can recall them
easily; before you are to speak, review them again.</p>

<p>When you are called upon, see the first word of
your list and with it you will see a picture which
will remind you of the first point you wish to make.
The picture made with the next word of your list
will suggest your next point, when you are ready
for it. There is no limit; use as many words of the
list as you have different points in your speech.
When you have used this idea once you will never
do without it; you will remember all the points of
your talk and you will use them in the order you
intended. Hundreds, who have never spoken in
public without notes, are now doing so by the use
of this method. Others, who have been able to
speak without notes have been troubled by getting
the points out of order or after sitting down have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
realized that they have omitted an important one.
With this idea you can entirely overcome such a
difficulty.</p>


<h3>Originality and Effort</h3>

<p>Help the child to cultivate the habit of originality
and not to be afraid of trying new ideas. Do not
always suggest a picture, let him work and create
one for himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Effort is the price of increased mental power&mdash;the
result will be secured in no other way.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Make lists of groceries, errands, etc., for the child
to practice with. If he has no need of using the
Hitching Posts now, deliberately make the need, so
that he can form this valuable habit.</p>


<h3>The Mind's Eye and the Story</h3>

<p>An excellent time for the development of the child
is "story time." Have him use his imagination and
make mind's eye pictures while you are reading
stories. The story book naturally becomes a picture
book in the child's mind. When you are reading a
story, stop occasionally and have him form his own
picture of it. You will find that he can easily see
little Red Riding Hood going down the road to her
grandmother's house. Encourage this habit of mental
picturing of all stories and rhymes read to the
child.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>This is a natural mental operation but the lack of
knowledge of its importance and consequently the
failure to continue it after we have learned to read
is one of the great causes of our forgetting what we
read so easily. If you will see to it that your child
visualizes what you read to him, and as he learns
to read for himself stops occasionally to picture
what he has read, he will develop a wonderful memory
along this line. He will study easily, retain accurately
and make more progress with less effort
than any child who does not visualize and is forced
to depend upon repetition.</p>


<h3>The Game of Story Telling</h3>

<p>Read a story from the child's story book; have
him make pictures of the story as you read; when
you have finished, let him tell the story from his
Mind's Eye picture, and see how completely he can
retell it. If points are omitted, call the child's attention
to them and help him to include them in
his picture. When several children are together
have one retell the story and the others add what
they can to it. See to it that the retelling is from
visual pictures. This is excellent training for future
school work.</p>


<h3>Two Results of Visualization</h3>

<p>Beside the memory value of visual impressions of
the story there is another important result. You
cannot visualize the thing that you do not understand.
If you do know about it you can see it clearly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>If the child has difficulty in picturing what you
have been reading it may be because he does not
understand it. Here is your opportunity to explain
and add to his definite knowledge. Visualization
results in increased understanding and in a greater
ability to remember. These are the important results
sought in study and the formation of this habit
in your children will pay wonderful dividends in
their education.</p>


<h3>Learning Poetry and Prose</h3>

<p>The value of the mind's eye picture will be much
appreciated when the child comes to learning verbatim.
Every author has a picture in mind which
he describes in words. He attempts to make the
word description so clear that those who read will
also see the picture.</p>

<p>Children who have not yet learned to read will
naturally form pictures in their minds as you read
the story. When you wish to have the child learn
the story or poem, the mind's eye picture will be of
the greatest aid. Practice with some of the examples
following; make clear pictures and review
them several times; aid the child in understanding
the words that he finds are difficult.</p>

<p>Note the pictures described by the authors in the
following poems and prose selections.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Hare and the Tortoise</h3>

<p>A hare boasted loudly to a tortoise of her speed
in running, at the same time giving him a look of
scorn because of his slowness.</p>

<p>"Let us have a race," answered the tortoise. "I
will run with you five miles, and the fox over yonder
shall be the judge."</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>The hare with a scornful smile agreed, and away
they started together.</p>

<p>Soon the hare left the tortoise far behind, and
feeling a little tired, lay down on a tuft of grass
that grew by the way. "If that slow-coach passes,
I shall see him and easily catch up with him again,"
she said to herself, and fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the meantime the tortoise plodded on, slowly
but surely. After a time, he passed the hare, who,
sure of reaching the goal first, still slept, and who
awoke only to find the tortoise had reached it before
her.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>These examples will serve to show the attempt of
the author to paint a picture with words, just as
does an artist with paint. Have the child make his
own picture and repeat the story as fully as possible.
Older children should learn them so as to repeat
them verbatim. In the next book on&mdash;How to Study
and Remember&mdash;this subject will be taken up more
fully.</p>


<h3>To Preserve Early Memories</h3>

<p>We sometimes doubt when people tell us of things
which happen when they were five years old. Children
that are eight or nine can often tell of things
that took place when they were two or three. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
without exception you will find that these
memories are eye impressions&mdash;pictures. Have the
child review those which you wish him to retain
and he will preserve the memory of them.</p>

<p>It is often the case that children have advantages
of travel and see many things that older people
have not. Many of these advantages, however, are
wasted because the child does not review these interesting
things which he has seen. Children are
seldom interested in remembering. Parents should
preserve the child's memory of important sights and
circumstances by asking him to carefully revisualize
the scene&mdash;to see it again in the mind's eye.
Thus can the impression be deepened and the child's
memory and appreciation of the thing be made to
continue throughout his life.</p>

<p>Especially all unusual scenes which he may not
have the opportunity of seeing again for a long time
should be visually reviewed a couple of times during
the first week and a number of times during the
following month. Two children had been camping
in the north, where they one evening saw a particularly
brilliant display of Northern Lights. A few
months after this the children were asked, "What
are the Northern Lights? What do they look like?"
The younger one had forgotten, but the older one
could describe them. When the two had thoroughly
reviewed the picture they had re-impressed it upon
their minds. By doing this a few times the children
were able to permanently retain this memory.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW TO REMEMBER FIGURES</h2></div>


<p>A child soon comes to the necessity of remembering
numbers. With some this is not difficult for they
possess unusual powers of visualization and can see
the numbers clearly in their mind's eye and thus
recall them with ease. There are many examples
of men and women who have this visual memory for
figures. On the other hand only a very small proportion
can do this.</p>

<p>It is a common failing among children, as well as
adults, to be unable to remember numbers easily.
The reason is simple. Numbers have no meaning,
they convey no impression to the mind which can
be retained.</p>

<p>Words convey the picture of objects, thoughts and
actions which you can visualize. Numbers are cold,
inanimate things which have no life nor interest,
they do not present a picture and are not easily retained.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Things that have no meaning are difficult to
remember.</b></p></blockquote>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>The simple transference of the meaningless number
into something of interest and within the child's
knowledge and experience will be helpful. He will
remember 15 apples easier than just the number 15.
Numbers are easily dealt with when they become
objects. You teach the child to add and subtract
by the counting board, or by using a group of objects.
Fractions are most easily explained by cutting
an apple, or something which we can see.</p>

<p>A man had received a new auto license number
and wondered how he could remember it, 218515.
He knew the easiest way was to make it mean something.
He thought that 21 was the age when a
young man reaches his majority. If he lives to be
85 he will be an old man, and he might be entirely
destitute but for the 15c. So he had the figures
21-85-15. After that he had no difficulty in recalling
this number at any time.</p>

<p>Be original and make the figures mean something.</p>


<h3>Familiar Numbers Helpful</h3>

<p>Any number which has come to mean something
to you is easily recalled and may be helpful in remembering
other numbers. As 1492, the date of
the discovery of America by Columbus. 57 immediately
recalls "Heinz 57 varieties" and if you wish
to remember 59 you can easily associate it as being
two more than the 57. 1775 means something to
you, it conveys a definite thought, but it is more
likely that 1947 does not and will be quickly forgotten.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>If you have lived in a house with the number 1947
for a good while you will remember it as easily as
the number 1775.</p>


<h3>Analyze Numbers</h3>

<p>There are many helpful ideas which can be used
to aid in remembering numbers. To divide the number
into pairs of digits, keeping them below one
hundred, is helpful. It is easier to remember 14-67
than 1,467.</p>

<p>Even numbers which are familiar to us are easily
remembered as 10, 20, 30, 40, or 100, 200, 300, or
1000, 5000, 10,000. To compare other numbers
with these familiar groups will help, as 29 is one
less than 30, 996 is just four less than 1000.</p>

<p>Numbers having sequence of digits if noted carefully
will be recalled accurately, as 1357 or 2468.</p>

<p>The telephone number 2430 is easily remembered
because of the even numbers, 24 and 30. Also
2+4=6 and 24+6=30.</p>

<p>Sometimes the first digits added together make
the other, as the license number 1247, the first three
added make the fourth.</p>

<p>All these ideas are at times helpful, but we need a
method which can be used any time, by any one, for
any figures. This need is adequately met by the
Number Code following. It is not new, but supposed
to have originated among the Romans and has
been used by almost every generation since that
time. You find it easy to impress upon the brain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
any thing which has a meaning and which can be
visualized.</p>

<p>Figures carry with them no associations, no images.
It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise
some means by which they may be photographed
upon the brain in such a manner that they will mean
something, as definitely as a word represents an
object.</p>


<h3>The Number Code</h3>

<p>The simplest and most practical basis which can
be selected is the idea of choosing a SOUND to represent
each one of the ten digits. These sounds can
in turn be indicated by various consonants of the
alphabet. By combining the ten digits we are able
to make all figures, and by similarly combining the
SOUNDS we can easily convert the figures which
we wish to remember into words. The words will
represent objects and can easily be impressed upon
the brain. Your use of this idea is based upon your
becoming thoroughly familiar with the ten SOUNDS
representing the ten digits.</p>

<p>By combining these sounds corresponding to the
arrangement of the digits, words can be formed to
represent the figure. The word can be remembered.
It has a meaning. It can be visualized and recalled,
then easily translated into the corresponding digits.</p>

<p>Here are the ten digits and their corresponding
SOUNDS. The sounds are indicated by the letters.
Use the sound as spoken in the word, as "T" in
"Ten." The sound used is always the same as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
the spoken word, but not as a single letter. Not the
sound "en" as a letter, but the sound of "N" in
"Nell." Note this difference; it is important. Following
is the Number Code:</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_067.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Note carefully this cut in which the digit and letter
used to represent the sound is made into a combined
figure. This places the digit and the corresponding
sound into your mind together. The picture
of the combination should be impressed by
concentration. Look at the digit letter and then
close your eyes and see the same picture in your
mind's eye. Exaggerate them. Take a pencil and
paper and draw them for yourself. Note that the
second letter N if stood on its side is 2, in the picture
it is half way, which will suggest both to your mind.
The M and 3 are the same. Become familiar with
these so that there is no possibility of hesitation in
recalling the SOUND for each digit.</p>

<p>The T and 1 are simple. The 2 and N and the 3
and M have been explained. The 6 turned to the
left makes a J. The K for 7 is made of two 7s back
to back, one leaning against the other. The P for
9 is turned as the 6 and J. Dwell a moment on this
picture and you will know the Code.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>There are other associations which will help to
fix the digits and their corresponding sounds in mind.</p>

<p>T is selected for 1 because both are made with
one down stroke. One down stroke with a short
cross stroke makes the T.</p>

<p>N, for 2 is the same, two down strokes make the N.</p>

<p>M represents the 3 and there are three down
strokes in the written M.</p>

<p>R is the last letter and principal sound in the word
fouR, which has four letters.</p>

<p>L is the Roman numeral representing 50, similar
to 5.</p>

<p>F selected for 8 has the two loops, when written.</p>

<p>C is the first letter and sound of the word Cipher.</p>


<h3>Acquaint Yourself With the Code</h3>

<p>Work entirely by SOUND, remember it is the
sound M in the word Make that has the value of 3,
and if not <b>sounded</b> would have no value. Become
familiar with these ten digit sounds so that when
you see a digit you can immediately recall the sound.
Then practice sounding words and telling the number
value of each SOUND in the word. Pay no attention
to the letters; only the sounds have value.</p>

<p>The ten sounds alone will not form words, but will
by adding the vowels A, E, I, O, U. The vowels
have no figure value and can be used at any time
and in any manner desired without altering the
number value of the word. In the same manner we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
use the consonants W, H and Y. These have no
figure value and with the vowels may be used to
bind the digit sounds into words.</p>


<h3>A, E, I, O, U and W, H, Y Are Valueless</h3>

<p>For practice translate the following numerals into
their corresponding sounds.</p>

<p>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 3 6 5 8 3 2 8 0 5 3 6 8 7 4 2 8 5 1 7.</p>

<p>In the same manner translate the following letters
into their corresponding digit value. Remember the
vowels and W, H, Y have no figure value.</p>

<p>T N M R L J F P C E F H R K Y F R N L Y F W
K N R T E O K L A Y E R P M U N P L T H F Y E
R O M I N K O U N L P T R N W M F.</p>

<p>Keep up this practice with both digits and letters
until you can translate each without hesitation.</p>


<h3>Forming Number Words</h3>

<p>It is a simple matter to form a word for a figure
by selecting the sounds which represent the digits
and fill in vowels until the word is found.</p>

<p>14 is represented by the sounds T-R. Between the
consonants T and R run the vowels a, e, i, o, u. Do
this by sound and the result is TaR, TeaR, TiRe,
ToR (tore), TuR (tour). In this way you have three
or four words which will represent the number 14.</p>

<p>15 can be converted into TaiL, TiLe, TeLl, or
TooL.</p>

<p>41 into the words RaT, RaTe, wRiTe, RooT, RuT.</p>

<p>91 into the words PaT, PeT, PiT, PoT, PuT.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>Make yourself thoroughly familiar with the Number
Code. Master the ten digit sounds and you have
the foundation with which to work. This is not a
difficult problem. Children learn without difficulty
the 26 letters of the alphabet and their many combinations.
In this case there are but ten to be mastered
and many combinations to choose from. A
little practice will work wonders in the ability to
use this Code. Change the following words into
their figure value:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="table">

<tr><td>PaN................</td><td>    JaR................</td><td>    NoTe...............</td></tr>
<tr><td>RaiN...............</td><td>    CoaL...............</td><td>    TaN................</td></tr>
<tr><td>KiTe...............</td><td>    PiLe...............</td><td>    MoP................</td></tr>
<tr><td>RaKe...............</td><td>    PoP................</td><td>    JaiL...............</td></tr>
<tr><td>LaP................</td><td>    TaNK...............</td><td>    PaiL...............</td></tr>
<tr><td>LeTTeR.............</td><td>    PiNK...............</td><td>    PeaR...............</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Note the following translation of numbers into
words. Do the last sets yourself, make others for
practice in this idea:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td class="right">38</td><td class="right">  M F</td><td>  MuFf.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">92</td><td class="right">  P N</td><td>   PaN.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">63</td><td class="right">  J M</td><td>   JaM.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">142</td><td class="right">   T R N</td><td>    TuRN.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">315</td><td class="right">   M T L</td><td>    ............</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">415</td><td class="right">   ............</td><td>   ............</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">912</td><td class="right">   ............</td><td>   ............</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">951</td><td class="right">   ............</td><td>   ............</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">421</td><td class="right">   ............</td><td>   ............</td></tr>
</table>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Add the necessary vowels to make these into
words:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>82</td><td>    F N</td><td>      921</td><td>    P NT</td><td class="right">       327</td><td>   M NK</td></tr>
<tr><td>21</td><td>    N T</td><td>      627</td><td>    J NK</td><td class="right">      9521</td><td>   PL NT</td></tr>
<tr><td>48</td><td>    R F</td><td>      295</td><td>    N PPL</td><td class="right">    91420</td><td>   P T RNS</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Make complete words for the following:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">
<tr><td class="right">29..............</td><td class="right">   97..............</td><td class="right">   57..............</td></tr>
<tr><td class="right">470..............</td><td class="right">    742..............</td><td class="right">    515..............</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Additional Letters</h3>

<p>The simplicity and ease with which you will be
able to use this idea can be increased by noting that
there are certain letters which have practically the
same sound as those selected to represent the digits.
Yet these sounds are entirely different from any
other digit sound. You can greatly increase the list
of words which you can make for certain numbers
by taking advantage of this idea. This is a very
helpful suggestion; note it carefully.</p>

<p>All letters having the same sound stand for the
same digit value:</p>

<p>D and T are similar in sound and therefore either
can be used to represent the digit 1.</p>

<p>G as in George (known as soft G) has the same
sound as J, therefore soft G also represents 6.</p>

<p>Sh as in Shot, and Ch as in Chain are similar to J
in sound so Sh or Ch represent 6.</p>

<p>C as in Can, hard C, has the sound of K and is 7.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>G as in Gag, is the same as K and also is valued
as 7. K, hard C or hard G are all used for 7.</p>

<p>V has the sound of F, and either may be used for 8.</p>

<p>B has the sound of P and is 9.</p>

<p>S as in Sauce, and Z are sounded as C (soft) so
that either C, S or Z can be used for 0.</p>


<h3>The Complete Code</h3>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_072.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<h3>Letters and Sounds Seldom Used</h3>

<p>The following are sometimes used and from their
SOUND have digit value and should be noted for
completeness:</p>

<p>Q sounds similar to K and is 7.</p>

<p>X is pronounced EKS, has the KS sound and is 70.</p>

<p>Hard Ch as in ACHE has the K sound and is 7.</p>

<p>Gh and Ph as in Cough and Phone have the F
sound and are 8.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>By using the suffix ING to represent 7, which is
an arbitrary exception to fill a need, you can get a
great deal of help in forming words for difficult
numbers which end in 7, as 447 RoaRING, 117
DoTING, 577 LacKING, 397 MoPING.</p>


<h3>Silent Letters Have No Figure Value</h3>

<p>In addition to a, e, i, o, u, and w, h, and y, which
have no figure value, all silent letters have none,
because they are not SOUNDED. SOUND is the
one and only indicator of digit value.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NIGHT is 21 for the GH is silent.</p>

<p>KNIFE is 28 for the K is silent.</p>

<p>MADGE is 36 for the D is silent.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Double Letters Are Sounded as One</h3>

<p>Because they have but the one letter SOUND they
have but the single digit value. This is merely another
fact which is unalterable, because the basis
of the Code is sound.</p>

<p>HUMMER has the sound of HUMER and is 34.</p>

<p>BITTER has the sound of BITER and is 914.</p>

<p>SPARROW has the sound of SPARO and is 094.</p>

<p>BILL has the sound of BIL and is 95.</p>

<p>The important thing to keep in mind in the use of
this Code is the fact that all is based upon SOUND.
Silent letters and double letters are treated as they
are, simply because of the SOUND basis. There are
many exceptions to the number value of the letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
but none to the number value of the sounds of the
word.</p>

<p>The word NATION is a good example. NATION
is 262. In this case the T as a letter would represent
1, but as a SOUND it is "SH" and is 6. C is 6
in OCEAN.</p>


<h3>Number Value of Code Words</h3>

<p>You now need to have a series of words, the figure
value of which you are thoroughly familiar with, to
use as a basis for quickly forming word pictures for
numbers which are given you to remember. A list
of words representing the number 1 to 100 would
be of the greatest value to you. These words you
would be familiar with and as soon as any number
of two digits was mentioned a word-picture of this
value would come into your mind. The word-picture
you could easily retain in mind, the number
you could not.</p>

<p>Take for example the number 1. This is represented
by either T or D. For this illustration we select
the T. Now in order to make a word which you
can visualize you use the vowels or the extra consonants
W, H or Y. From these we can make a
word for 1.</p>

<p>Let us take the T and the vowels I, E, which have
no value, and we have the word TIE, which has the
value of 1. Many other words could have been
made which would have the same number value as
Hut, Hat, Head, Hood, Weed, Wheat, Tea, Toe,
Dew, Dye.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>SNOW is 2; the S, O and W have no value, leaving
the N for 2.</p>

<p>HOME is 3; H, O and E have no value, leaving the
M for 3.</p>

<p>WIRE is 4; W, I and E have no value, leaving the
R for 4.</p>

<p>WHEEL is 5; W, H, EE have no value, leaving the
L for 5.</p>

<p>SASH is 6; S, A have no value, leaving the Sh
for 6.</p>

<p>EGG is 7; E has no value, GG has but one sound
and is 7.</p>

<p>IVY is 8; I and Y have no value and V is 8.</p>

<p>WHIP is 9; W, H and I have no value, leaving P
for 9.</p>

<p>TOES is 10; O and E have no value and T and S
are 1-0.</p>

<p>By the use of the Number Code each of the words
selected for the Child's Code List has a number
value running consecutively from Tie which is 1 to
Daisies, which is 100. Each word stands for its corresponding
number always; by sound they are interchangeable
with the number at any time for any
purpose.</p>

<p>Figure out, by the Number Code, the value of each
word of the Code List as given here, in disorganized
form, and write it opposite the word.</p>

each of the Code Words, turn back to them on page

in proper sequence by number value.</p>


<h3>The Game of Number Code</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_077a.jpg" alt="Front" />
<p class="caption">Front</p></div>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_077b.jpg" alt="Back" />
<p class="caption">Back</p></div>

<p>After becoming familiar with the values of the
number Code, the Game Code, given on page 42, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
be very much improved in its complexity,
and consequently, in its resulting
mental development.</p>

<p>Have the one hundred words on
one side of the card and the corresponding
numbers from one to one
hundred on the reverse side as illustrated.
Deal all the cards, have no
draw pile. All cards in the hand
and in reserve piles on the table are
to be with the words up and the
numbers down. Start by playing
the cards into the middle of the
table with the numbers up, beginning
with cards which bear numbers
ending in 1. The next card is
played word up upon the pile; then,
if no one calls "Code," turn the card
over and if it should be that this
card does not bear the following
consecutive number the card must
be replaced in the player's hand and
the player ceases with no penalty.
If, when the word is played, some
other player, who knows by the
number value of the word that it is an error, calls
"Code" before the card is turned over, then, if correct,
he is entitled to give the player a card from his
hand. The game is played and scored as in Code,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
but has the added value of requiring the players to
know the number value of all the words.</p>


<h3>The Number Game</h3>

<p>This game will assist in learning the number value
of the words and the word for each number. Shuffle
the cards from the Code Games, have one person
hold these cards out of sight of the players. The
reader turns all cards with the words up and reads
the word on the top card. The first one to tell the
proper number value of the word gets the card. In
this way go through the entire pack, each person retaining
the cards which he obtains by first speaking
the number. The one holding the most cards at the
end of the game is the reader for the next game.</p>

<p>The same game may be played by reading the numbers
and seeing who can first speak the Code Word.</p>


<h3>The Game of Solitaire</h3>

<p>If you wish to practice alone, take the Code cards
and shuffle with the words up, noting the time when
you begin. See how quickly you can go through the
entire set, naming the numbers for the words. Then
reverse the process and name the words for the
numbers.</p>

<p>Now try it again and see if you can cut a few seconds
off the time. Keep a record of the time required
to go each way and strive continuously to reduce
it. Keep at this until you can go through the
100 cards in two and a half minutes or less.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>


<h3>Another Game of Solitaire</h3>

<p>Take the Code cards and shuffle them thoroughly
then arrange them in their consecutive order, beginning
with Tie and following with each word in its
proper place. For another test start ten rows of
cards upon the table, each starting with a Code
word ending in one, as Tie, Dot, Net, Meat, Heart,
etc. Now follow each card with the next word in
its list, placing the cards in their proper lists as you
come to them. This will help you to become acquainted
with the words in their proper order and
to become familiar with them.</p>

<p>The above exercises will increase in interest if you
consider them from the number value. Shuffle the
set and arrange them in consecutive order, thinking
of the number value of the word, but not referring
to the number on the back of the card unless forced
to do so. The second test will be arranging them in
sets of ten, beginning with 1, 11, 21, 31, 41, etc.</p>

<p>Shuffle the cards again and arrange them in the
following order, always using the words but figuring
their number value for your guide in the arrangement.
Arrange them in horizontal lines thus:</p>

<p class="center">
1-11-21-31-41-51-61-71-81-91<br />
2-12-22-32-42-52-62-72-82-92<br />
3-13-23-33-43-53-63-73-83-93<br />
4-14-24-34-44-54-64-74-84-94<br />
5-15-25-35-45-55-65-75-85-95<br />
6-16-26-36-46-56-66-76-86-96<br />
7-17-27-37-47-57-67-77-87-97<br />
</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>Follow through the set in the same manner. After
you have completed any of these tests, reverse it and
do the same, beginning with the larger numbers and
working back to the smaller ones.</p>

<p>Vary these exercises in as many ways as you can
and keep track of how long it takes you to do a certain
test, then do it again and see how much you can
reduce the time required. For a guide in these tests
the Code List is printed here with each corresponding
number value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>After you have become familiar with the number
values of the Code words it will guide you in case of
any doubt as to the sequence of any words. If you
should be in doubt as to whether Chief or Ship comes
first you can prove the point by referring to the
number value; Chief is 68 and Ship is 69, therefore
the sequence is correct.</p>


<h3>All Hitching Posts Numbered</h3>

<p>Note that when you have the Number Code to
work with that each Hitching Post has a corresponding
number so that each item in your list is numbered.
For purposes of filing information this is
very helpful. You think of the Hitching Posts now
as 1-2-3-4-5-etc. The word is simply an interchangeable
object with a fixed value and 1 automatically
becomes Tie in the picture. And when it appears
in the picture it means 1. So on with all other numbers
and words under one hundred. For use as
Hitching Posts each list of ten in the list can be
used as having the 1 to 10 value by dropping the
first digit, as Net (2)1, Nun (2)2, Enemy (2)3,
Nero (2)4, etc.</p>

<p>In working with the Code bear in mind every
moment that the word is synonymous with the number.
The number stands for the word and the word
for the number, they never change. They mean now
and always the same thing. Each stands for the
other. This statement can not be made too strong.
Neither can you be urged too strongly to practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
with your children in the use of it. Become so
familiar with it that when you hear the sound T it
immediately means 1 and so on through the entire
list. Words now have an added significance; for
this purpose they have become and from this time
they will be NUMBERS, as well as WORDS.</p>

<p>Always keep in mind that SOUND determines the
number value of the word regardless of how it is
spelled.</p>


<h3>Forming Larger Number Words</h3>

<p>In order to form words for larger numbers first
become familiar with the figure value of the one
hundred code words. These will often combine to
form the larger number pictures. For example:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td align="right">695</td><td>  Sash&mdash;Pail</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">1291</td><td>  Town&mdash;Bat</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">2499</td><td>  Nero&mdash;Papa</td></tr>
<tr><td align="right">8240</td><td>  Vine&mdash;Rose</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A combination picture of Nero and Papa would
represent 2499. The danger of transposing the figures
by recalling the picture as Papa&mdash;Nero 9924
instead of 2499, can be avoided by having the first
object much larger than the second. In the case of
2499 picture Nero larger than Papa, or see Nero
above Papa, or in front or preceding Papa. Adopt
one of these methods and use it.</p>

<p>After a little practice you will often form one word
for a number instead of combining the Code words.
The beginner would represent 1210 by the Code
words Town&mdash;Toes. Later he will recognize 1210<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
as the sounds T-N-T-S. Combining these sounds the
word TENTS will suggest itself.</p>

<p>If 1210 were a phone number and you made a clear
picture association of Tents with the Person or Place
you would have no difficulty in recalling the number.</p>

<p>Already you have an object representing the figures
from 1 to 100, but very often you will wish to use
figures far in excess of this. Any number in excess
of 100 and below 10,000, or any number of three or
four digits will be most easily handled by translating
it into two words of the Number Code, or if you
choose can be later worked into a single word. In
the beginning you will find help by working in the
following manner. Take the number 347. A combination
of the Code words would be Home Rock,
you could also use My Rock or Some Rock. Or you
can make the numbers into a single word. Put down
the figures thus:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>3</td><td>  4</td><td>  7</td></tr>
<tr><td>M</td><td>  R</td><td>  K</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Combining these letters with vowels you have the
word MARK. Now take the number 994, the code
combination for this number is Whip-Pear, or you
could make the single word Paper.</p>

<p>The number 315 can be made into a single word.
315 is MoDeL. Translate the following into single
words; refer to the Number Code, on page 72, when
in doubt or in need of a suggestion. First, always
sound the digits then let the sounds form into a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<h3>Further Practice in Word Forming</h3>

<p>It is not always necessary to put a vowel between
the code sounds. Some letters combine into words
without vowels between, as&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>CuRTaiN&mdash;7412</td><td>   CLuTTeR&mdash;7514</td><td>    FaRMING&mdash;8437</td></tr>
<tr><td>BRaND&mdash;9421</td><td>     PReaCHeR&mdash;9464</td><td>   SPeNT&mdash;0921</td></tr>
<tr><td>PLaNT&mdash;9521</td><td>     BuRGLaR&mdash;94754</td><td>   SiLKS&mdash;0570</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Also note that some words begin with vowels:
Envelope for 2859; Amber for 394.</p>

<p>If at first you cannot easily form words for all
numbers, do not be discouraged. Practice will give
you most words instantaneously. Soon you will instantly
recognize numbers like 285 as Novel; 741
as Cart; 101 as Toast. This ability will come quickly
if you practice and in no other way will you acquire
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>


<h3>Adjectives as Helps</h3>

<p>You have already found that some numbers of
three digits cannot be made into a single word.
Others that can be translated into words are sometimes
difficult of visualization. To overcome these
difficulties and to add greatly to the rapidity with
which you can form large numbers, use adjectives
for the first digits and the words of the Code list for
the others. The combination is quickly made and
easily recalled. You will find that in larger figures
of six digits the idea works equally well.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">
<tr><td>1</td><td> Hot, Wet, White</td><td align="right">   6</td><td> Huge, Shy, Ashy</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td> New or No</td><td align="right">   7</td><td> Sick, Gay, Weak</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td> My or May</td><td align="right">   8</td><td> Heavy, Few, Wavy</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td> Sour, Raw, Hairy</td><td align="right">   9</td><td> Happy or Webby</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td> Low, Oily, Yellow</td><td align="right">   10</td><td> Dizzy</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Select one of the adjectives for each digit and become
familiar with it and use it continuously, unless
another improves the sense materially.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>165</td><td> Hot Jail</td><td align="right">  666</td><td> Shy Judge</td></tr>
<tr><td>263</td><td> New Jam</td><td align="right">    776</td><td> Weak Cage</td></tr>
<tr><td>333</td><td> My Mama</td><td align="right">   829</td><td> Heavy Knob</td></tr>
<tr><td>498</td><td> Hairy Beehive</td><td align="right">  993</td><td> Happy Bomb</td></tr>
<tr><td>568</td><td> Yellow Chief</td><td align="right">  1035</td><td> Dizzy Mail</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The adjectives will be of great assistance as well
in forming words for four digit numbers:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>1149</td><td> Hot Trap</td><td>   7195</td><td> Weak Table</td></tr>
<tr><td>2262</td><td> New Engine</td><td>  8941</td><td> Heavy Bird</td></tr>
</table>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>A few additional examples of adjectives will show
how helpful this idea can be made:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>12&mdash;Thin</td><td>    21&mdash;Neat</td><td>    72&mdash;Keen</td></tr>
<tr><td>13&mdash;Dim </td><td>    32&mdash;Mean</td><td>    77&mdash;Quick</td></tr>
<tr><td>14&mdash;Dear</td><td>    46&mdash;Rich</td><td>    82&mdash;Fine</td></tr>
<tr><td>15&mdash;Tall</td><td>    58&mdash;Live </td><td>   65&mdash;Jolly</td></tr>
<tr><td>16&mdash;Dutch </td><td>  62&mdash;Shiny</td><td>   97&mdash;Big</td></tr>
</table>

<p>For practice translate the following by use of adjectives
and Code words, where possible, or adjectives
and three digit words.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>127............</td><td>    1147............</td><td>  21147............</td></tr>
<tr><td>932............</td><td>    1932............</td><td>  29595............</td></tr>
<tr><td>478............</td><td>    2746............</td><td>  32649............</td></tr>
<tr><td>531............</td><td>    9127............</td><td>  61492............</td></tr>
<tr><td>397............</td><td>    1392............</td><td>  45921............</td></tr>
<tr><td>729............</td><td>    7146............</td><td>  72952............</td></tr>
<tr><td>635............</td><td>    6592............</td><td>  15864............</td></tr>

<h3>Telephone Numbers</h3>

<p>Remembering telephone numbers is a practical
application of the Number Code which can be helpful
to all. There is probably no combination of figures
you are more often called upon to remember
than these. When you need them you need them
at once. Master the Number Code and you will
find that it has paid you many times in this application
alone.</p>

<p>Translate the phone number into words and associate
them with person, office, place of business, or
in any way that will make a good picture which will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
be easily recalled. The illustrations which follow
are instances taken from actual practice.</p>

<p>Hotel&mdash;phone number 1740, THE CARS may be
used to represent 1740. This hotel, the Brown Palace,
in Denver, is a triangular building with cars
running on every side, suggesting "THE CARS."</p>

<p>Fire Department&mdash;phone number 3084. MISS
FIRE stands for 3084. An easy association is that
the fire men miss the fire.</p>

<p>Bank&mdash;phone number 9795. Here we substitute
BIG BILL for 9795, a bank which has many a BIG
BILL.</p>

<p>Railroad&mdash;phone 1784. TAKE FARE association.
The railroad always takes your fare.</p>

<p>Laundry&mdash;phone 7540 COLLARS. Association.
Collars are in the laundry.</p>

<p>Butcher&mdash;phone 531. ALL MEAT. The butcher
sells ALL MEAT.</p>


<h3>Telephone Exchanges</h3>

<p>Knowing the district in which the phone is located
will often suggest the exchange, but when necessary
make a Reminder Picture for the exchange.
Following are some examples which have been used
by students:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Main&mdash;The Battle Ship</td><td>   Harrison&mdash;Hair or Hare</td></tr>
<tr><td>East&mdash;Yeast</td><td>   Randolph&mdash;Ran off</td></tr>
<tr><td>Beacon&mdash;Lighthouse</td><td>   Champa&mdash;Champion</td></tr>
<tr><td>Wabash&mdash;Wash</td><td>   Proctor&mdash;Doctor</td></tr>
</table>

<p>These are suggestions only, much depends upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the individual; make your own reminders. The
same exchange may be more easily remembered by
different visual images for each of us. Use the
means that suits you best. If the exchange is represented
by a reminder make the double visual impression,
as&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
An Abstract Co., Champa 1208<br />
They have the Champion TIN SAFE<br />
A Restaurant, Main 8518<br />
They have Main(ly), VEAL TOUGH<br />
</p>


<h3>Remembering Addresses</h3>

<p>A student was asked to call upon a party at 2214
Third Street, and was cautioned by the man giving
the address that he had better write it down. The
student remarked, "It isn't necessary, I can easily
remember it." Which remark, needless to say, created
a favorable impression. 22 is NUN, 14 is
DEER. The student made a mental picture of a
NUN leading a DEER HOME (Third Street).</p>

<p>Another address was 1939, which is quickly transferred
to a picture of a TUB and a MOP.</p>


<h3>Remembering Fractions</h3>

<p>Fractions can be converted into words and thus
carried in the mind with exactness. A great many
are illustrated in the following list. These words
all begin with the letter S for uniformity and to
make it easy to remember that the word represents
a fraction:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>1/2&mdash;Stone</td><td>    1/5&mdash;Steel</td><td>    9/10&mdash;Spats</td></tr>
<tr><td>4/5&mdash;Sorrel</td><td>   1/8&mdash;Stave</td><td>    1/6&mdash;Stage</td></tr>
<tr><td>1/4&mdash;Steer</td><td>   5/6&mdash;Sledge</td><td>   3/5&mdash;Sawmill</td></tr>
<tr><td>3/4&mdash;Summer</td><td>   1/3&mdash;Stem</td><td>     7/8&mdash;Skiff</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Other words can be made for the other fractions.
1/7 would be Stock and 2/7 Sneak, and 3/7 Smack.
A combination of these words with the Code list will
help with fractions. 9-1/4 would be WHIP STEER.
12-2/5 is TOWN SNAIL. 54-1/2 is LAIR STONE.
35-1/6 is MAIL STAGE.</p>


<h3>Remembering Department Numbers</h3>

<p>In learning the department numbers in a large
department store it is simply necessary to associate
the goods sold in the particular department with
the Code word, and if desirable, the name of the
buyer can be associated also.</p>


<h3>Remembering Color Numbers</h3>

<p>The color numbers in a wholesale house, some
sixty of them, were learned by one student while
reading them over slowly. Color Number 1 is Black,
BLACK TIE. Color 12 is Gold, a GOLD TOWN. A
little more difficult is 51, Gettysburg gray. Here a
man is wandering over the fields of Gettysburg in
the Gray dawn with a LADY (51).</p>


<h3>The Game of Memory Demonstration</h3>

<p>Excellent practice and a great deal of pleasure
can be had by letting some one give the child a
series of ten words to be remembered in connection
with the numbers which are written opposite them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
They can be given out of order and this will make a
stronger impression and be as easy for the child.</p>

<p>The numbers 1 to 10 will be represented in his
mind by the Code words TIE to TOES. Each will
be pictured in turn with the word given for the
number. Let the one giving the words write the
numbers 1 to 10 in a vertical line, and as he writes
the word opposite tell them to the child taking the
demonstration. For example&mdash;5 is Window. This
immediately becomes a picture of the WHEEL (5)
and a Window. Throw the Wheel through the
Window. Next he might be given 10, BOOK. A
picture of TOES and Book. 3 is FIRE, a picture of
a HOME (3) on Fire. 1 is CANDY, sticks of Candy
bound up in a TIE (1).</p>

<p>Each word and number are to be visualized together.
When the ten have all been given, the child
begins with 1 (TIE) and recalls the object he pictured
with it; next 2 (SNOW) and recalls the word
pictured with it, and so on to the end of the ten.
Recall each one in sequence even though given out
of order.</p>

<h3>A practice demonstration:</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>5&mdash;Window</td><td>   1&mdash;Candy</td><td>   4&mdash;Bank</td></tr>
<tr><td>10&mdash;Book</td><td>     9&mdash;Fish</td><td>    6&mdash;Apple</td></tr>
<tr><td>3&mdash;Fire</td><td>    8&mdash;Auto</td><td>    2&mdash;Stone</td></tr>
<tr><td>7&mdash;Horse</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Begin with 1 and recall them in sequence.</p>


<h3>A Number Demonstration</h3>

<p>Instead of the words, as used in the preceding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
game, follow the same plan as with two digit numbers,
as&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>1 is 29</td><td>   4 is 100</td><td align="right">    7 is 35</td></tr>
<tr><td>2 is 93</td><td>   5 is 61</td><td align="right">     8 is 12</td></tr>
<tr><td>3 is 57</td><td>   6 is 44</td><td align="right">     9 is 98</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td align="right">10 is 86</td></tr>
</table>

<p>This is simply a combination picture of two Code
words. One is TIE and 29 is KNOB, a picture of a
huge red TIE hanging on a KNOB will answer the
purpose.</p>

<p>2 is SNOW and 93 is BOMB, a big, black, sizzling
BOMB in the SNOW bank. Picture each pair as
given and recall them by first recalling the Code
word for the position in the list and it will be associated
with another object in the picture, the number
value of which is the number as given.</p>

<p>Accuracy in this game is dependent upon being
familiar with the Code, know the sounds, and if the
Code word for 57 does not come to mind easily use
any word with the two sounds L and K and it will
represent 57. You could use the word Lake, Elk,
or Leg, any one of which will enable you to remember
the number.</p>

<p>Other uses of the Number Code will be given in
the next book, and there will be found many applications
of it to the needs of the child in his school
work. It is helpful in many ways and should be
mastered both for its usefulness and for the value
in mental development which will come from practicing
with it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">REMEMBERING PEOPLE'S NAMES</h2></div>


<p>To forget names is a common failing. Many people
can remember faces but fail when it comes to
recalling the name. This is mostly the result of inattention.
Remembering names is more difficult
than remembering some other things, and for this
reason many have fallen into the habit of not trying.</p>

<p>One thing which contributes largely to this neglect
is a lack of definite knowledge of how to accomplish
the result. The principles of memory, as
given previously in this book, can be applied to prevent
this common failure.</p>

<p>While children do not have to remember names
as much as adults do they should have the principles
well in mind and be trained in the use of them.
They should form the habit of paying attention to
the names and remembering them. Parents should
require them to call the people they meet by name
and to realize the value of being able to do so. Almost
every one can remember faces of strangers
more easily than they remember names. This is because
of the difference in strength of the two senses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
used in making the impressions. The eye nerve
carries the picture of the face to the brain. The
ear carries the sound of the name. As we have
learned, the eye impression is nearly twenty times
stronger than the one made by the ear.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Eye impressions are lasting and can be recalled
when the impressions by the other
senses can not.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>It may be helpful to illustrate the result of your
meeting with a Mr. Penn in the following graphic
way. In the following drawing let the curve represent
the surface of the brain, and the depth of
the groove the comparative impressions made by
the two senses.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_093.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>This could illustrate the strength of the two images
under the conditions, where the face was seen
only as the name was heard. On the other hand,
this is not usual, as a rule you hear the strange
name but once, but you see the face for several
minutes, sometimes for half an hour. During the
time that you are looking at the face the eye is making
a deeper and deeper impression upon your brain.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>The ear never has had and never can have the
same ability to impress the brain as the eye. It will
never be possible to remember names as easily, or
for as long a time as faces, if you depend upon the
impressions as normally placed upon the brain by
the senses.</p>


<h3>To Remember Names</h3>

<p>The problem then is to first equalize the impressions
of the face and name so that each will last and
can be recalled with equal ease. The impression
of the face was made by your physical eye; at the
same time there is your mind's eye faculty which is
dormant, not being used. With it you can learn to
make an impression of the name upon your brain
which will be as strong as the face impression made
by the eye.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>In order to recall with equal ease two mental
impressions, they must be made with equal
strength.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>When you meet a stranger his face becomes a picture
impression upon the brain, the first impression
of the name is made by the ear, but it can easily
and quickly be made into a mind's eye picture which
will be many times more available. This mind's
eye picture can be unusual, exaggerated, and moving,
so that its strength can be regulated at will.
The result will be two visual impressions, the face
by the eye, the name by the mind's eye. These can
be equalized by repetition so that when you recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
the face it will be possible to recall the name
as well. Let us adapt the former illustration and
we have a picture of the face and a picture of the
name impressed upon the brain.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_095.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Instead of retaining only the slight impression
made by the ear, you can have two impressions,
both made by the sense of sight. Apply this knowledge,
and remembering names will become a much
simpler matter.</p>


<h3>The Name Picture</h3>

<p>When you heard the word Tie spoken you quickly
transferred the ear impression into a mind's eye
picture of a TIE. Do the same with the name of
Mr. Penn. This is a word which has a definite meaning
and it suggests a concrete picture. You can
see the pen; see all the details of its shape, size,
markings, etc. See this in your mind's eye, visualize
this picture of the word pen. It can be exaggerated
and you can animate it and put it into motion with
many unusual or ludicrous circumstances. In other
words, this Name Picture can be as firmly impressed
upon your brain as you wish it to be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>


<h3>Association Next Important Step</h3>

<p>When you wish to remember the Tie and Snow
together, or to use the Tie to recall the Bread, you
took advantage of the Law of Association. The
two were pictured together and thus impressed
upon the brain at the same time. If you wish to
be able to recall the name when you see the face
you must associate the Face Picture and the Name
Picture together in the same impression.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_096.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>You will remember that success in the use of associated
picture impressions depend upon one of
the objects in the picture being familiar and easily
recalled. In this case the Name Picture is associated
with, or hitched to, the Face Picture. The
Face Picture will always be present when the name
is wanted. The person may come into your home,
or you may meet him outside, in each case when
you see the face it will bring to your mind the picture
of the name.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>


<h3>To Remember Mr. King</h3>

<p>When you meet a stranger take this opportunity
to get a Face Picture of this person impressed upon
the brain. When you hear the name, King, you
have a light temporary ear impression
of it. Take this ear
impression of the name and
quickly transfer it into a mind's
eye picture of the king. Then
into this picture of the king
place the face picture, see the
face of this Mr. King sitting on
the throne, wearing the crown
and robes and waving the scepter.
Make this Name Picture
strong, exaggerated and unusual.
Here you are combining
a mind's eye impression
with a physical eye impression and the one is definite,
a real thing, while the mind's eye impression
seems, in comparison, to be vague and indistinct.
It is a strong impression, nevertheless, and very
little experience and practice will be necessary to
prove its value and availability.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_097.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>You must, of course, hear the name distinctly.
You can not remember it if you do not know what
it is. The first impression of the name must be
definite and certain, do not hesitate to ask to have
the name repeated or even spelled. The person
will be complimented that you are making an attempt
to remember him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>It will help you to become conscious of these
mind's eye pictures if you will look away from the
stranger's face for a moment and see both the face
and name pictures in the visual impression which
you have been forming. This can be done for an
instant during the conversation, or at some other
opportunity.</p>


<h3>Associating Name and Face Pictures</h3>

<p>Go into any savage or semi-civilized tribe today
and you will find that names are given because of
some trait of character; some peculiar characteristic;
some unusual appearance or accomplishment.
About fifty per cent of the names you meet with
are nouns, words with a meaning which suggests
definite, concrete pictures, which can easily be associated
with the faces of the persons just as we
have done here with the name King. Note these
examples:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Mr. Gun </td><td>     Mr. Starr</td><td>    Mr. Wells</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Stone</td><td>    Mr. Ring </td><td>    Mr. Bell</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Cotton </td><td>  Mr. Street</td><td>   Mr. Penn</td></tr>
</table>

<p>There are thousands of names just as simple, including
colors, animals, birds, fish, fruits, and almost
every object. All these can be easily visually
associated with the face.</p>


<h3>Obtain a Meaning by Change</h3>

<p>Many names do not come under the classification
of a direct and simple meaning because of a little
change which may have been made in the manner
of spelling them. Others can be converted into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
some simple meaning which can be easily impressed
upon the mind by making a slight change and spelling
the names as they sound. In other words, by
remembering them as they sound rather than as
they are spelled.</p>



<p>The following examples are
common:</p>
<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_099.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Rhodes&mdash;roads<br />
Mr. Coyle&mdash;coil<br />
Mr. Knoble&mdash;noble<br />
Mr. Reuter&mdash;rooter<br />
Mr. Baran&mdash;baron<br />
Mr. Asche&mdash;ash<br />
Mr. Lyon&mdash;lion<br />
</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Use the picture here as Mr. Perrett. The name as
it sounds calls to your mind a bird. See the bright
green parrot flying around his head and perching
on his shoulder; see the vivid color of the bird.
Close your eyes and review this picture association
of the face and the name. Do this until you can
see it with your eyes open.</p>


<h3>Meaning in First Syllable</h3>

<p>Many names which seem to present difficulties
upon first hearing them simply need a little attention
and analysis. At times when names have escaped
you, you have gone back to the alphabet and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
by running over the letters have found that the first
letter suggested the name wanted. Some names
which are apparently difficult will be easily remembered
if you will notice that the first syllable of the
name is a noun and has a definite meaning.</p>

<p>You meet Mr. Carruthers. This name presents
considerable difficulty until you notice that the first
three letters spell the simple word "car." By visually
associating the object "car" with his face and
repeating the name Carruthers a couple of times,
you will find no difficulty in recalling the name.</p>



<p>Note these examples of this method of using the
first syllable for the Name Picture:</p>
<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_100.jpg" alt="" /></div>


<p>
Mr. Bellamy&mdash;bell<br />
Mr. Reardon&mdash;rear<br />
Mr. Raymond&mdash;ray<br />
Mr. Seagraves&mdash;sea<br />
Mr. Ringling&mdash;ring<br />
Mr. Burroughs&mdash;burr<br />
Mr. Dennison&mdash;den<br />
Mr. Bushnell&mdash;bush<br />
Mr. Boardman&mdash;board<br />
Mr. Pierson&mdash;pier<br />
</p>




<p>Practice with this idea by using the face here as
Mr. Woodhead. See a stick of wood on his head,
pile it there and see it roll off, don't be afraid to
make strong, unusual Name Pictures. You will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
have to tell the man how you remembered his name,
but to do it will be one of your greatest business
assets.</p>


<h3>Meaning of Vocations</h3>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_101.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Almost every vocation has been used as a proper
name. Undoubtedly the name comes from the fact
that the forefathers followed that vocation. In
every such case see the person
working at the trade. For
practice use this man as Mr.
Smith, suggesting a blacksmith;
see him working at his
forge, see the anvil, the
sparks, the hammer, see him
strike. Make a strong, vivid
picture. (Smith comes from
the word Smythe&mdash;meaning
hitter.)</p>



<h3>Other examples:</h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Mr. Miller</td><td>      Mr. Fisher</td><td>    Mr. Shoemaker</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Carpenter</td><td>   Mr. Plumber </td><td>  Mr. Butcher</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Gardner</td><td>     Mr. Painter</td><td>   Mr. Walker</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Each name picture of a vocation should contain
the scenes which are familiar to you. Mr. Carpenter
has a hammer and nails, working at the carpenter
trade; Mr. Gardner, with hoe and spade, is caring
for his garden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>


<h3>Familiar Name Pictures</h3>

<p>There are many names which do not have a meaning
and are not readily changed to suggest a picture
to be associated with the Face Picture. On the
other hand, these names will suggest Name Pictures
with which you are thoroughly familiar. They will
suggest a location, article, place, or some familiar
fact that can be used for the Name Picture and
which will recall the name to your mind when you
see the face.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Make it a rule to associate the unknown with
the known.</b></p></blockquote>


<h3>Geographical Name Pictures</h3>

<p>The first one of five groups of familiar pictures of
proper names is the Geographical group. You meet
a stranger by the name of Mr. Lansing, and the
name immediately suggests the city of Lansing,
Mich. If you are familiar with the city of Lansing
you can very easily make a visual picture of this
person standing in some particular street or familiar
corner of the city.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_103.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>It is not necessary, however, to have a personal
knowledge of the geographical location. The picture
association of a stranger's face with the geographical
location will be sufficiently strong if you
see him holding the map of Michigan and pointing
out the spot where Lansing is, or any other similar
picture which may suggest itself to you.</p>




<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Use this picture for Mr.
Holland. This name immediately
suggests a picturesque
country of Europe.
See this strange face by a
Dutch windmill and the people
in their distinctive costumes
grouped around, see
motion in your picture, the
windmill turning and the
people passing by.</p>



<p>A few common geographical
names follow:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Mr. Birmingham (Ala.)</td><td>   Mr. Ogden (Utah)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Billings (Mont.)</td><td>    Mr. Platte (River)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Davenport (Ia.)</td><td>     Mr. Cleveland (Ohio)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Lyons (France</td><td>)      Mr. Patterson (N. J.)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Hudson (River)</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In some cases you can make a change in the spelling
of the name and in this way associate it easily
with a geographical picture. As:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Mr. Bostrom (Boston, Mass.)<br />
Mr. Knoble (Knoblesville, Ind.)<br />
Mr. Molan (Moline, Ill.)<br />
Mr. Haig (Hague, Holland)<br />
Mr. Jameson (James River)<br />
Mr. Bixby (Bisbee, Ariz.)<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>


<h3>Advertised Name Pictures</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_104.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>There are scores of proper names which, as soon
as mentioned, will bring to your mind the picture of
an object which has been
constantly advertised. Having
seen this article so often
has fixed its picture and
name indelibly in your mind.
As soon as you see the article
you can without hesitation
speak the name. When
you meet a stranger by the
same name, as you often
will, associate the Face Picture
of the stranger with the
familiar object for your Name Picture. When you
see this face again you will recall the object which
you can name without difficulty. For example, the
face here may be of a Mr. Gillette, who may not be
familiar to you, but if you hear the name Gillette it
suggests the picture of a Safety Razor. When you
meet a stranger by this name, see him shaving himself
with a Gillette Razor. Review your picture a
few times and when you meet the man again his
face will suggest your Name Picture and you can
call his name from the object in the picture. There
are many opportunities to use this method, your own
city will have many familiar trade marks and signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
which you can use, as well as those nationally advertised.</p>

<p>A few examples:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Mr. Hudson (auto)</td><td>      Mr. Sanford (ink)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Campbell (soups)</td><td>    Mr. Douglas (shoes)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Armour (meats)</td><td>      Mr. Cluett (shirts)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Knox (hat) </td><td>         Mr. Parker (pens)</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Names Suggest Familiar Faces</h3>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_106.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Many names immediately suggest familiar faces,
which you can name any time, anywhere. You
often compare the strangers you meet with them
and note the similarities. Constant repetition has
fixed these faces so thoroughly in mind that there
will be no confusion in naming them. You pass a
stranger on the street and some one says: "How
much that man looks like Lincoln," and you reply,
"Yes, but Lincoln was taller and did not have such
large eyes, and his nose was entirely different in
shape. And Lincoln's mouth was fuller, too, not so
thin and straight." This comparison is possible,
because of the clear, definite picture which has been
formed in your mind of President Lincoln.</p>



<p>These familiar faces which you can recall so definitely
in your mind's eye will be of wonderful as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>sistance
in remembering
strangers by the same name.
Practice with this picture as
Mr. Grant. His face may
be strange to you, but the
name immediately suggests
a familiar face. Now see
these two faces in the same
picture, see the familiar face
looking over the face of the
stranger, see them meeting,
shaking hands, talking,
laughing. Exaggerated, moving, unusual pictures
are best. See the familiar faces clearly as possible,
and compare the two; one is tall and the other short,
one dark the other light, one has a beard and the
other has not, etc. All comparison helps to make
the mind's eye picture more definite and to strengthen
the associated picture through prolonged attention.</p>



<h3>Historically Known Faces</h3>

<p>The faces of these familiar names are fixed in
your mind by reading history, as&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Gen. Sherman </td><td>   Thos. Jefferson </td><td>   Gen. Kitchener</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gen. Lee  </td><td>       Geo. Washington </td><td>   Benj. Franklin</td></tr>
<tr><td>Gen. Sheridan</td><td>    Wm. McKinley </td><td>      Admiral Dewey</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Some names suggest both geographical and historical
reminders. For example:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">
<tr><td>Livingston</td><td>    Raleigh </td><td>   Chester</td></tr>
<tr><td>Columbus </td><td>     Decatur</td><td>    Hannibal</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Other Well-Known Faces</h3>

<p>A much larger number of names will suggest faces
which have become fixed in your mind by your having
seen their pictures in magazines, papers, cartoons,
etc.; men who are active in politics and the
accomplishments of the present day. These you can
connect in the same way; use the known face as
the name picture; see the two faces together; put
your mind to the comparison, make it active, feel
interested. When meeting strangers do not allow
your mind to be dormant, make it work, this is imperative.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>A dormant mind is impregnable; an active
mind is absorbent.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Notice how the cartoonist observes the peculiarities
of appearance and exaggerates them in his
pictures; don't be afraid to use your imagination in
your mind's eye pictures for remembering men's
names.</p>

<p>Examples of well-known faces:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>Mr. Bryan</td><td>     Mr. Balfour</td><td>     Mr. Ford</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sen. Kitchen </td><td>  Gen. Pershing </td><td>  Mr. Edison</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mr. Hoover </td><td>    Mr. Baker </td><td>      Mr. Wright</td></tr>
<tr><td>"Joe" Cannon</td><td>   Mr. Daniels </td><td>    Mr. Schwab</td></tr>
</table>

<p>How many of these faces can you see clearly in
your mind's eye? How definite are they?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>


<h3>Make Use of Your Friends' Names</h3>

<p>The names of your friends with which you are
thoroughly familiar will bring to your mind a clear
visual impression. You can see the face as soon as
the name is mentioned, not of the few but literally
of hundreds of people. Learn to take advantage
of this great series of Name Pictures, which you can
indelibly hitch to the Face Picture of the stranger
who chances to bear the same name. Use the same
method as before, see the two faces clearly, compare
them to make the mind's eye picture of the
friend's face definite. Use motion, think, become
interested, and every other means to make a strong,
lasting impression.</p>


<h3>Observe the Facial Appearance</h3>

<p>The peculiarities of appearance which are easily
detected by the physical eye constitute one of the
most helpful methods of associating the face and
the name together. You will find as you practice
that this means is very often available. It is not
possible to take advantage of this opportunity, however,
unless you are observing. In fact, to the unobserving
person there is no peculiarity about the
appearance and therefore no aid.</p>

<p>For this purpose it will pay to give considerable
attention to the development of the observation.
You will find the stranger's appearance more and
more helpful to you as you develop your ability to
observe keenly the faces of the persons whom you
meet. Many people have some distinctive or prominent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
characteristic which will directly suggest the
name, or with which the name may be associated.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_109.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Note this peculiarity of the stranger's face, and
quickly associate it with the name as you hear it.
Use your imagination and
strengthen the association as
much as possible, enlarge
and make more prominent
the peculiarity which you
have noticed. If you meet a
Mr. Cole and his hair is
dark, note the fact. See his
hair as black as coal, in your
picture. Imagine taking a
big piece of soft coal and
rubbing it over his hair to
blacken it. The picture here is for Mr. White; note
his snow-white hair and mustache; note these facts
carefully, they will suggest the name immediately
upon your seeing the face again.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can use the whole face, sometimes
only certain peculiarities, a deep wrinkle, a scar, a
blemish, etc. Sometimes it will be the general build
of the body or the expression of character. Sometimes
the similarity will be very noticeable. Other
times the decided contrast will be as useful in fixing
them in mind.</p>

<p>Color of hair or complexion is often helpful and
may be more apparent if you use the idea of changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
spelling, or taking the name as it sounds rather than
as it is spelled. A few examples follow:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Short is a small man&mdash;short.</p>

<p>Mr. Biggar is short and slender, suggesting that
he could be bigger.</p>

<p>Mr. Stout&mdash;is very slender.</p>

<p>Mr. Smiley&mdash;is stern and cross looking.</p>

<p>Mr. Gray&mdash;has gray hair.</p>

<p>Mr. Redman&mdash;has rosy, pink cheeks.</p>

<p>Mr. Molar&mdash;has a large mole(r).</p>

<p>Mr. Fisher&mdash;has deep wrinkles, fissures.</p>

<p>Mr. Baldy&mdash;is very bald.</p>

<p>Mr. Reddish&mdash;has sandy hair, reddish.</p>

<p>Mr. Remlinger&mdash;is bald with a rim of hair lingering.</p>

<p>Mr. Eyer&mdash;has bright, keen eyes.</p>

<p>Mr. Cloes&mdash;looks close and stingy.</p></blockquote>


<h3>Other Helpful Associations</h3>

<p>The circumstances under which you meet a
stranger may easily lead you to a strong association
which will impress the face and name strongly upon
your mind.</p>

<p>To meet&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Dombville (dumbbell) in a gymnasium suggests
a good picture.</p>

<p>Mr. Long&mdash;keeps you a long time talking, and you
easily remember the name when you meet him
again.</p>

<p>Mr. Pugh (pew) you may meet at church.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>


<h3>Vocational Hints</h3>

<p>Something about a man's business or the things
he sells may help you. When you meet a man and
find difficulty in picturing his name ask him what
business he is in; this is well to know and may be
helpful in remembering the name. All the examples
given in this lesson are actual circumstances,
not flights of imagination. This vocational idea is
helpful because it starts you thinking about the
name. Thought is the important factor. If you
will learn to think intently you will remember.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. McCash&mdash;is employed in a bank.</p>

<p>Messrs. Puls &amp; Puls&mdash;are dentists.</p>

<p>Mr. Caution&mdash;is a banker.</p>

<p>Mr. Kamerer&mdash;sells Kodaks (cameras).</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Thought Channels</h3>

<p>The law of association is wonderful in its operations,
and the principles upon which it operates can
be relied upon to help in cases where it seems almost
impossible to make a picture impression. The
thoughts you think when you see the face will return
when you see it again, just as the conversation
and other circumstances do. In trying to remember
names that are difficult to picture, think intently
about them, silently ask and answer questions about
the person or his name, think of the peculiarity and
just how it is spelled. See the name spelled in large
letters, clear and definite. The Law of Association
will tend to recall these impressions when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
see the face, and by their aid you will in most cases
be able to recall the peculiar and difficult name.</p>

<p>Because a name is difficult few remember it, and
its possessor is "bored to death" by continually repeating
and spelling it. Here is your greatest opportunity;
to remember this name will make a
greater impression than if it were an easy one.
When you feel that you cannot do anything else
with a name think intently about it, make your mind
active, become interested, stimulate some strong
feeling of pleasure at meeting him, give the impression
a strong stimulus.</p>


<h3>Review Is Essential</h3>

<p>In an earlier chapter we found that a mind's eye
picture would last for hours, but if discarded, or
not reviewed, it would gradually fade away, time
will inevitably erase it.</p>

<p>We also learn that to retain an impression permanently
it must be reviewed several times and
preferably at frequent intervals. Names of the people
you meet, whom you wish to remember, must
become permanent knowledge and must be reviewed
or you cannot expect to accomplish the result.
While the visual picture can make the strongest possible
impression it will not become permanently
available unless reviewed.</p>

<p>This review and practice in the use of the visual
faculty will gradually improve the strength of the
mind's eye picture and develop the habit of attention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
and concentration. The first review should be
made shortly after the first impression, to insure its
being distinct and vivid. Even while talking with
the party see again your name picture associated
with the face. Most names get away from you during
the first thirty seconds after hearing them.
Quickly make your Name Picture, associate it with
the face and then review it. After a short interval
do it again; when the party leaves call him by name
and as soon as he is gone review the mind's eye picture
of his Face and Name.</p>

<p>It is helpful to call a stranger by name during the
conversation, speaking it clearly and distinctly. This
will be of special value to those who have found that
they are ear minded.</p>

<p>When being introduced to a group of people whose
names you wish to remember, do not go rapidly, take
a reasonable time to each name. After you have met
four or five find some opportunity to glance back and
review the faces of their associated Name Pictures,
then meet a few more. As soon as possible review
all the names in your mind. In no other way can
you expect to remember a number of them. At least
not until you have gotten considerable practice, and
this is the way to practice.</p>


<h3>Methodical Review Best</h3>

<p>This review of the names of the strangers you have
met is one of the very necessary links in your success.
You should do so each evening, or at some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
other convenient time of the day. Quietly go over
the day's experiences and recall the faces and names
of all the people whom you have met. Each name
should be reviewed several times, by means of this
review you can meet and name the stranger often
enough to make his name as familiar as you wish.
When he meets you the second time, you will surprise
him by readily calling him by name. He may
say, "Why, how do you remember my name; you
only met me once?" The fact is you have met him
as many times as you have visually reviewed his
name and face together.</p>

<p>The most accurate method of review is to write the
name of each stranger into a small note book, or on
a pad on your desk. Each time you review the name
check it off; after you have checked it five or six
times you will be familiar with it and can dispense
with further review.</p>

<p>Merely to go over the list and check the names is
of very little value, the review that will get results
is the visual review of your associated picture. See
both the name and face pictures again, review
names and faces just as you would House and Clock
by seeing the picture.</p>


<h3>A Review Test</h3>

<p>Use the pictures of men given in this chapter, and
review; as you read each name stop a moment and
see the face as clearly as possible in your mind's eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

</table>


<h3>Good Observation Necessary</h3>

<p>While it seems easy to retain a picture of the face,
yet the value of the impression for quick and accurate
recognition will depend upon the observation of it.
The games and exercises given in the first book will
have developed this faculty in the child, but you
should call his attention to the value of it here and
urge the importance of making a special effort with
the faces of the people whom he meets.</p>

<p>After the person, to whom the child has been introduced,
has gone, see how much of a description he
can give you of him. Help him to be systematic in
his observation. First, estimate his height, weight,
and general build. Second, tell the color of his hair,
eyes and complexion; size and shape of his nose,
chin, etc. Third, how did the child like him? Encourage
him to form a definite conclusion as to just
what kind of a person the visitor is. This is important
and will be helpful later, but will need careful
guidance in the formative years. Helps which you
can give in reading character should be imparted
to the child. Tell him all that you can of how you
judge and estimate people, encourage him to study
this important subject as he grows older. There are
very helpful and scientific books available on this
subject.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>The ability to recognize and remember people,
without regard to their name, is based upon just this
kind of an observation and study of them. Observation
is the resulting mental image after the removal
of the object from view. Your ability to observe
people is measured by what you can definitely
recall about them when they are gone. Recognition
of them will be based upon the memory of just these
points mentioned and in turn the memory, of course,
can be no more distinct than the impressions made
upon the brain while the person was before you.
Observation then is the basis for the recognition of
people, and to improve it is of utmost importance.</p>


<h3>Systematic Observation of Faces</h3>

<p>There are three principal steps or points to be
noticed. First, the size and general build. This can
be done while the person is approaching as well as
at the introduction. Because of the similarity of
faces the size and build of a person will often be the
point that will insure accuracy in recognition. You
see a person at a meeting who looks very much like
Mr. A whom you met yesterday, but Mr. A was a
tall, slender man, this man is of medium build, and
so the difference in size helps greatly in determining
the identity. When meeting a stranger get a general
outline picture of him. It will be helpful to
make a mental comparison between the stranger and
yourself, as to size, etc.</p>

<p>Second, the observation of the face should be especially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
keen and attentive, both for purposes of recognition,
and because the face becomes the Hitching
Post for the name. When being introduced, and
during the conversation, study the face carefully.
First as a whole for a general impression, and then
in detail. Notice the hair first, determine its color,
condition, heavy, sparse, bald or curly, and note any
peculiarity. Then observe the eyes, nose, mouth,
ears and complexion. Form the habit of starting at
the top of the head; be systematic; and let the attention
move from one feature to another.</p>

<p>What is the result, how much will you later recall?
No more, and in fact no less than you can now see in
your mind's eye picture when you look away or
close your eyes for a moment. Apply this test and
then look back again and improve the mind's eye
picture. Add to it as much more detail as possible.
Be especially careful about noticing the peculiarities
of this face; any wrinkle, blemish or oddity of any
kind will be helpful in later remembering it.</p>

<p>A natural memory for faces may be good, but it
can be improved, this kind of definite effort will get
results. Any uncertainty in recognizing people will
be largely eliminated by improved observation. For
practice in this observation of faces use pictures in
magazines or papers as well as the faces of the people
you meet.</p>

<p>Third, let the observation of the face be crystallized
into a definite opinion regarding this person.
Instead of considering him as an object of which you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
are trying to get an especially good mental picture,
consider him now as an individual and decide how
you like him. Help the child to form correct opinions.
To know the business in which he is engaged,
place where he lives, his avocation, and favorite form
of recreation will all aid in forming a strong and
definite impression of this person. It is not always
possible to go to this extent, but get as far as you
can with it, the more you succeed the more help you
will have in remembering. Each effort will aid the
memory in that particular case&mdash;and help to form
the valuable habit of close observation.</p>


<h3>The Game of Faces</h3>

<p>Get a number of pictures of strange faces, such as
you often see of a convention, or take them from
magazines. Cut them apart and take five of these
faces and observe them carefully. Make a deliberate
effort to note any peculiarity of these faces or
anything about them that will help you to identify
them. Mix the five among the rest, now run through
the entire group of pictures and see if you can, without
hesitation, pick these five from the others. Practice
until you can do this. Leave these five faces
out of the group and select five more; observe these
in the same manner. Now mix the last five with the
large group and identify them as you did the first
five. Now take the ten and shuffle them into the
large group and identify them the second time.
Divide the ten in the two original groups of five so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
that you have the first five and the second five separate.
When several children are playing this game
together a score may be kept.</p>

<p>Mental operation becomes habitual and such practice
will help the child form the habit of close observation
of faces. The more difficulty he has in accomplishing
this the more it shows his need of just
such mental training. Let a week or so elapse and
then go back to this same group of pictures and try
the same exercise again, urge the child to look away
once or twice and to make a real effort to build up
his mind's eye picture.</p>

<p>Have several sets of pictures of faces so that this
exercise can be continued as often as possible.</p>


<h3>Progress by Practice</h3>

<p>To recognize people accurately and to be able to
call by name is a wonderful asset in business or in
social life. Your children can have this advantage if
you will see to it that they realize its importance and
make a deliberate effort while young. They will easily
form the habit and thank you for it all their lives.</p>

<p>The ideas and principles in this chapter should be
studied by the parent and imparted to the child as he
advances in years and becomes able to use them. Do
not make the common error of waiting too long or
expecting the child to get this for himself. We all
like to have children remember our names as well as
to have elders do so. The pictures which appear on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
the preceding pages were for the purpose of practice
and should be learned.</p>


<h3>The Name Game</h3>

<p>Take the same pictures used in the Face Game, on
page 116, and put the names of each on the back.
Now learn the name of five, making good strong
name pictures, use every idea suggested in the chapter.
Review the five and learn five new ones, now review
the ten, and follow this plan until you have
learned not less than twenty names.</p>

<p>Take the twenty learned and shuffle them and lay
them one at a time on a table in front of you. Try to
name the person instantly; wait only a moment and if
you do not recall his name, place the card in a pile by
itself. Go through the twenty and see how many you
can name; do this often for practice. Use this group
every day until you are familiar with all. Enlarge
the group by learning ten new ones each day. When
possible have some one hold the pictures for you. Try
always to improve the score and also to decrease the
time necessary to name the group. If there is more
than one person learning the names, make a game of
the idea, each taking the picture which he names
first, seeing who can get the largest number.</p>


<h3>The Game for Quick Naming</h3>

<p>After several persons have learned the names of
the pictures shuffle the cards and deal equally to the
players. The one to the right of the dealer lays a picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
in front of the player on his right and immediately
starts counting slowly from one to ten. The person
on his right must name the picture before the
other counts ten. If he succeeds in doing so he takes
the card and starts a pile in front of him on the table
face down. If he fails, the one on his right has an
opportunity to name the face while the one showing
the card again counts ten. The opportunity to name
this card passes on to all players, the first one giving
the correct name keeping the card and continuing
the play by showing one of the dealt cards to the person
on his right. If no one succeeds in naming the
card, the one playing it tells the name and adds the
card to his pile on the table and shows another. The
play continues as long as any one has any of the cards
dealt. When all are out each counts his pile on the
table, secured by properly naming them, and the one
having the largest number wins.</p>


<h3>The Game of Introductions</h3>

<p>Take a group of strange pictures and have someone
show five or more to you and name them as if you
were being introduced to strangers. Use your knowledge
of how to impress the faces and names upon
your mind. Do not pass them too quickly; take time
to be sure. Just this practice which you are now
doing will make it possible for you to go more rapidly
and at the same time to be accurate.</p>

<p>After you have been introduced to the group of
pictures, let the person hold up any one, you naming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
it, and so on through the group. Keep at this Introduction
Game until you have become able to meet ten
strangers and later name each.</p>

<p>Think what this ability will mean to you in business
and in winning the favorable attention of your
fellow men. Carry a few small pictures in your
pocket, using odd moments in which to practice with
them. Paste them on cards and use them while riding
on the street car. Practice for profit.</p>


<h3>Suggestions to Travelers</h3>

<p>Traveling salesmen or others whose work takes
them back to a city occasionally will find great help
in keeping a written list of the names of those whom
they have met in each city. Carry the book with you
and as you are traveling towards the city, exercise
your mind by going over the list and making a visual
review of the faces and names of those whom you
may expect to meet when attending to your business
in this city. It will prove to be valuable to refresh
your memory from time to time.</p>


<h3>Same Principles Involved</h3>

<p>The problem of remembering names is the same as
remembering anything else and can be solved by the
use of the same general principles. Attention and
concentration are necessary and produced by the
visual picture. To recall this name at will you take
advantage of the Law of Association, and hitch the
Name Picture to the Face Picture. The face becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
our Hitching Post and when you see it you see with it
the mind's eye picture of the name.</p>

<p>Name should become permanent knowledge and
this is accomplished by an occasional review until
you have made a permanent impression.</p>


<h3>Remembering the Initial</h3>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to remember the initial as
well as the name. Often it is as hard to remember
initials as it is figures, because they have no definite
meaning. An inquiry as to the names which the initials
stand for, will be very helpful. It is much easier
to remember George Henry than the initials G. H.</p>

<p>Initials which occur in alphabetical sequence are
easily remembered and many times you will find
that the first letter of the name continues the sequence,
as: R. S. Thompson; F. G. Hibbard; D.
E. Ferris.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will find the initials spelling a single
word, as E. D. which can be taken to represent the
given name "Ed", which is short for Edward. You
will find many cases where the initials will spell a
simple word such as:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>R. A. Gunn (Rag).</td><td>   P. A. Scott (Pas-s).</td></tr>
<tr><td>R. I. Pitt (Rip).</td><td>   J. A. Marks (Jam).</td></tr>
</table>

<p>At other times the initials will be those of names
which are familiar to you because of historical, political
or other well known associations, as:</p>

<p>S. A. Burke&mdash;will remind you of Samuel Adams
Burke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>W. J. Casper&mdash;will suggest William Jennings Casper.</p>

<p>There are many initials which will represent titles
or well known ideas such as the names of lodges and
societies:</p>

<p>D. A. Rasmussen can easily be associated with the
D. A. R.&mdash;Daughters of the American Revolution.</p>

<p>C. E., Christian Endeavor or Civil Engineer.</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="4" summary="table">

<tr><td>D. R., Doctor.</td><td>   P. M., Post Master.</td></tr>
<tr><td>A. D., Anno Domini.</td><td>   N. W., North West.</td></tr>


</table>


<h3>Make Initials Into Words</h3>

<p>Another helpful idea is to make words beginning
with the initial, either descriptive words, or those
that can be associated with the business. You meet a
Mr. R. E. Pasley in a real estate business&mdash;R. E. Pasley,
Real Estate Pasley.</p>

<p>R. I. Sterns (a printer)&mdash;Red Ink Sterns.</p>

<p>H. R. Paul (hat dealer)&mdash;Hat Retailer Paul.</p>


<h3>Both Initials In One Word</h3>

<p>In many cases the two initials can be formed into
the same word, the first letter of the word being the
first initial and the last letter the last initial. The
following are some examples:</p>

<p>H. R. Gray. His hair is gray which helps to remember
his name and the initials can be made into
the word HaiR&mdash;HaiR Gray.</p>

<p>L. T. Robinson, LighT Robinson. (Mr. Robinson is
a light blond.)</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>M. L. Harber, MilL Harber.</p>

<p>C. D. Dauchy, CarD Dauchy.</p>


<h3>The Price Must Be Paid</h3>

<p>You realize full well the value of the ability to call
people by name. You have often wished that you
had this ability. It is one of the priceless assets in a
successful business career, and to attain it is to reach
one of the high principles of mental development.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The ability to remember proper names is not
an exceptional gift, but is an acquired faculty
based upon the use of simple means and of
personal effort.</b></p></blockquote>

<p>Knowledge is power, but only when applied. All
the knowledge in the world is of no value to its possessor
unless used. You are successful in life just in
proportion as you are using the knowledge which you
have.</p>

<p>A dependable memory for names as well as faces
is within your grasp. The knowledge imparted in
this lesson, simple as it may seem, has been used by
thousands of business men to develop reliable memories
for Names and Faces.</p>

<p>You will have many opportunities to prove it in the
next few days. Be true to the method. Make a deliberate
attempt in each case. Force your mind to
wake up and get on the job. Do not be content until
you have a definite association which you are going
to use to remember each particular name.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Under no circumstances allow yourself to neglect
the review. Each review adds new strength to the
impression. Only strong impressions can be recalled
at will. Make it a part of your business to remember
the names of the people to whom you are introduced.
Know every customer; if the list is a long one, do not
expect to learn them all in a week, but do not let a
day pass without fixing definitely in your mind the
names of several. Children should learn the names
of every scholar in the room and of all the teachers
in the school.</p>

<p>The persistent use of this definite knowledge will
accomplish results that now seem impossible. It is
the use of the knowledge that will bring progress.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>"He who learns and learns and acts not what
he knows is like the man who plows and plows
and never sows."</b></p></blockquote>

<p>You may feel yourself handicapped in life because
of a poor memory. This shortcoming can reasonably
be charged to a lack of right knowledge.</p>

<p>You cannot say as much for your children now.
What will you do to help them form the Memory
Habit early in life? Do not wait for them to do this
for themselves; it should be done now. You are the
child's guide&mdash;you are largely his will power. The
responsibility is squarely up to you.</p>

<p>Nature's rewards are ample. You will both be
fully repaid for every bit of effort.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>Nature's rewards are just. You or your children
will never reap the reward of a good memory until
both have paid the price of effort.</p>

<p>Your child WILL grow&mdash;he cannot stand still or
wait for your convenience.</p>

<p>He will form the Habit of Remembering or the
Habit of Forgetting&mdash;which shall it be?</p>

<p>You can multiply the profits of his life by helping
him to master his Memory&mdash;otherwise it will master
him.</p>

<p>Practice is the great need. Play the games and
develop the brain.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
